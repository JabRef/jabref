Describe the changes you have made here: what, why, ... 
Link the issue that will be closed, e.g., "Closes #333".
If your PR closes a koppor issue, link it using its URL, e.g., "Closes https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/47".
"Closes" is a keyword GitHub uses to link PRs with issues; do not change it.
Don't reference an issue in the PR title because GitHub does not support auto-linking there.
