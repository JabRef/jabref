# CHANGELOG.md and *.md

- jobName: 'CHANGELOG.md needs to be modified if indicated'
  workflowName: 'Check PR CHANGELOG.md'
  message: >
    You ticked that you modified `CHANGELOG.md`, but no new entry was found there.


    If you made changes that are visible to the user, please add a brief description along with the issue number to the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
    If you did not, please replace the cross (`[x]`) by a slash (`[/]`) to indicate that no `CHANGELOG.md` entry is necessary.
    More details can be found in our [Developer Documentation about the changelog](https://devdocs.jabref.org/decisions/0007-human-readable-changelog.html).
- jobName: 'CHANGELOG.md - only unreleased touched'
  workflowName: 'Source Code Tests'
  message: >
    While the PR was in progress, a new version of JabRef has been released.


    You have to merge `upstream/main` and move your entry in `CHANGELOG.md` up to the section `## [Unreleased]`.
- jobName: CHANGELOG.md
  workflowName: 'Source Code Tests'
  message: >
    You modified `CHANGELOG.md` and did not meet JabRef's rules for consistently formatted Markdown files.

# Submodules and branches

- jobName: 'Submodules not modified'
  workflowName: 'Check PR Modifications'
  message: >
    Your pull request modified git submodules.


    Please follow our [FAQ on submodules](https://devdocs.jabref.org/code-howtos/faq.html#submodules) to fix.
- jobName: no-force-push
  workflowName: 'Check PR Modifications'
  always: true
  message: >
    Hey, we noticed that you **force-pushed** your changes.
    Force pushing is a bad practice when working together on a project (mainly because it is [not supported well by GitHub itself](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/3478)).
    Commits are lost and comments on commits lose their context, thus making it harder to review changes.


    When the pull request is getting integrated into `main`, all commits will be [squashed](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits) anyway.
    Thus, your individual commit history will not be visible in `main`.


    In future, **please avoid that**. For now, you can continue working.
- jobName: 'Conflicts with target branch'
  workflowName: 'On PR opened/updated (check)'
  message: >
    Your pull request conflicts with the target branch.


    Please [merge `upstream/main`](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork#syncing-a-fork-branch-from-the-command-line) with your code.
    For a step-by-step guide to resolve merge conflicts, see <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line>.
- jobName: 'Source branch is other than "main"'
  workflowName: 'Check PR Modifications'
  message: >
    You committed your code on the `main` brach of your fork. This is a bad practice.
    The right way is to branch out from `main`, work on your patch/feature in that new branch, and then get that branch merged via the pull request (see [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)).


    For this pull request, this is OK.
    For subsequent pull requests, please start with a different branch with a proper branch name.
    See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-process) for more details.


# PR hygiene

- jobName: 'Ensure that contributor is assigned (fails if not commented on issue)'
  workflowName: 'Link PR to Issue'
  message: >
    You did not assign yourself to the issue.
    Thus, it looks like you skipped reading our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), which explains exactly how to participate. No worries, it happens to the best of us.


    Give it a read, and you’ll discover the ancient wisdom of assigning issues to yourself. Trust me, it’s worth it. 🚀

- jobName: 'PR title must not contain "issue <number>"'
  workflowName: 'Check PR Format'
  always: true
  message: >
    The title of the pull request must not start with "Fix for issue xyz".
    Please use a concise one-line summary that explains what the fix or change actually does.
    Example of a good title: "Prevent crash when importing malformed BibTeX entries".
- jobName: 'Mandatory Checks present'
  workflowName: 'Check PR Format'
  always: true
  message: >
    You have removed the "Mandatory Checks" section from your pull request description.
    Please adhere to our [pull request template](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md?plain=1).
- jobName: 'PR checklist OK'
  workflowName: 'Check PR Format'
  always: true
  message: >
    Note that your PR will not be reviewed/accepted until you have gone through the mandatory checks in the description and marked each of them them exactly in the format of `[x]` (done), `[ ]` (not done yet) or `[/]` (not applicable).
    Please adhere to our [pull request template](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md?plain=1).
- jobName: 'Determine issue number'
  workflowName: 'Link PR to Issue'
  always: true
  message: |
    Your pull request needs to link an issue correctly.

    To ease organizational workflows, please link this pull request to the issue by including a supported keyword in the pull request's description as per syntax described in [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

    ### Examples

    - ✅ `Fixes #xyz` links pull-request to issue. Merging the PR will close the issue.
    - ✅ `Fixes https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/xyz` links pull-request to issue. Merging the PR will close the issue.
    - ✅ `Fixes https://github.com/Koppor/jabref/issues/xyz` links pull-request to issue. Merging the PR will close the issue.
    - ❌ `Fixes [#xyz](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/xyz)` links pull-request to issue. Merging the PR will **NOT** close the issue.
