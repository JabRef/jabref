            Hey @{fc-author}! 👋


            Thank you for contributing to JabRef!


            We have automated checks in place, based on which you will soon get feedback if any of them are failing.


            After all automated checks pass, a maintainer will also review your contribution.
            Once that happens, you can go through their comments in the "Files changed" tab and act on them, or reply to the conversation if you have further inputs.


            Please re-check our [AI Usage Policy](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/AI_USAGE_POLICY.md) to ensure that your pull request is in line with it. It also contains links to our contribution guide in case of any other doubts related to our contribution workflow.
