            ### Hey @{fc-author}!

            Thank you for taking the time to contribute to JabRef. Your help is truly appreciated :heart:.

            We have automatic checks in place.
            Futhermore, we use [TragBot](https://usetrag.com/) with custom rules to enable you a more detailed feedback.
            Sometimes, TragBot does not perform well.
            In the "Files" tab, you can go through its comments and just click on "Resolve conversation" if the comment absolutely doesn't make sense.

            Please re-check our [contribution guide](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in case of any doubts.

            Don't forget to star :star: the repo.
