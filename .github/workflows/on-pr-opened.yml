            Hey @{fc-author}! 👋


            Thank you for contributing to JabRef!


            We have automated checks in place, based on which you will soon get feedback if any of them are failing.
            We also use [Qodo](https://www.qodo.ai/) for review assitance.
            It will upate your pull request description with a review help and offer suggestions to improve the pull request.


            After all automated checks pass, a maintainer will also review your contribution.
            Once that happens, you can go through their comments in the "Files changed" tab and act on them, or reply to the conversation if you have further inputs.
            You can read about the whole pull request process in our [contribution guide](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-process).


            Please re-check our [AI Usage Policy](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/AI_USAGE_POLICY.md) to ensure that your pull request is in line with it.
