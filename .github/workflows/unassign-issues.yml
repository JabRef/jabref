              If you are working on it, you can prevent automatic unassignment by:

              - Submitting a [draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) with your progress within {{ days_remaining }} days
              - Asking for the **{{{ pin_label }}}** label if you need more time
              </details>

              We appreciate your contribution and are here to help if needed!
