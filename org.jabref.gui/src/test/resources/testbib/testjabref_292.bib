  abstract = {A 3D microsystem for multi-site penetrating extracellular neural recording
	from the brain is presented. A 16 x 16-channel neural recording interface
	integrated prototype fabricated in 0.35 mu m CMOS occupies 3.5 mm
	x 4.5 mm area. Each recording channel dissipates 15 mu W of power
	with input-referred noise of 7 mu V-rms over 5 kHz bandwidth. A switched-capacitor
	delta read-out data compression circuit trades recording accuracy
	for the output data rate. An array of 1.5 mm platinum-coated microelectrodes
	is bonded directly onto the die. Results of in vitro experimental
	recordings from intact mouse hippocampus validate the circuit design
	and the on-chip electrode bonding technology.},

  abstract = {A rapid, reversible enhancement of synaptic transmission from a sensory
	neuron is reported and explained by impulses that reverse direction,
	or reflect, at axon branch points. In leech mechanosensory neurons,
	where one can detect reflection because it is possible simultaneously
	to study electrical activity in separate branches, action potentials
	reflected from branch points within the central nervous system under
	physiological conditions. Synapses adjacent to these branch points
	were activated twice in rapid succession, first by an impulse arriving
	from the periphery and then by its reflection. This fast double-firing
	facilitated synaptic transmission, increasing it to more than twice
	its normal level. Reflection occurred within a range of resting membrane
	potentials, and electrical activity produced by mechanical stimulation
	changed membrane potential so as to produce and cease reflection.
	A compartmental model was used to investigate how branch-point morphology
	and electrical activity contribute to produce reflection. The model
	shows that mechanisms that hyperpolarize the membrane so as to impair
	action potential propagation can increase the range of structures
	that can produce reflection. This suggests that reflection is more
	likely to occur in other structures where impulses fail, such as
	in axons and dendrites in the mammalian brain. In leech sensory neurons,
	reflection increased transmission from central synapses only in those
	axon branches that innervate the edges of the receptive field in
	the skin, thereby sharpening spatial contrast. Reflection thus allows
	a neuron to amplify synaptic transmission from a selected group of
	its branches in a way that can be regulated by electrical activity.},

  abstract = {Inability to culture adult central neurons and the failure of injured
	neurons to regenerate in the brain could be due to genetic controls
	or environmental inhibitors. We tested the environmental inhibitor
	hypothesis by attempting to regenerate adult rat neurons in B27/Neurobasal
	culture medium, a medium optimized for survival of embryonic neurons.
	To isolate neurons from their numerous connections, papain was the
	best of six different proteases screened on slices of hippocampus
	for survival of isolated cells after 4 days of culture. Use of a
	density gradient enabled separation of oligodendroglia and some enrichment
	of neurons and microglia from considerable debris which was inhibitory
	to sprouting and viability. With these techniques, about 900000 viable
	neurons were isolated from each hippocampus of any age rat from birth
	to 24-36 months, near the median mortality. FGF2 was found to enhance
	viability at least 3-fold to 40-80\%, independent of age, without
	affecting the length of the processes. Neurons were cultured for
	more than 3 weeks. These methods demonstrate that hippocampal neurons
	can regenerate axons and dendrites if provided with adequate nutrition
	and if inhibitors are removed. They also will enable aging studies.
	Therefore, the concept of environmental growth restriction may be
	more appropriate for neurons in the brain than the concept of a genetic
	block that precludes regeneration of processes.},

  abstract = {Two fundamental questions about neuron cell culture were addressed.
	Can one serum-free medium that was developed for optimum growth of
	hippocampal neurons support the growth of neurons from other regions
	of the brain? Is the region specific state of differentiation maintained
	in culture? To answer these questions, we isolated neurons from six
	other rat brain regions, placed them in culture in B27/Neurobasal
	defined medium, and analyzed their morphology and growth dependence
	on cell density after 4 days in culture. Neuronal identity was confirmed
	by immunostaining with antibodies to neurofilament 200. Neurons from
	each brain region maintained distinctive morphologies in culture
	in the virtual absence of glia. Cells isolated from embryonic day
	18 cerebral cortex by digestion with papain showed the same high
	survival as hippocampal neurons, e.g., 70\% survival for cells plated
	at 160/mm2. At this age and density, neurons from the septum showed
	slightly lower survival, 45\%. Survival of dentate granule neurons
	from postnatal day four brains was 30-40\%, significantly lower,
	and relatively independent of plating density. This suggests an absence
	of dependence on trophic factors or contact for dentate granule neurons.
	Growth of cerebellar granule neurons isolated from postnatal day
	7, 8, or 9 brains in B27/Neurobasal was compared to growth in BME/10\%
	serum. Viability in serum-free medium at 4 days was much better than
	that in serum, did not require KCl elevated to 25 mM, and occurred
	without substantial growth of glia. Cerebellar granule neurons plated
	at 1,280 cells/mm2 were maintained in culture for three weeks with
	17\% of the original cell density surviving. Survival of cells isolated
	from embryonic day 18 substantia nigra was 50\% at 160 cells/mm2
	after 4 days, similar to that of striatum, but slightly less than
	hippocampal neuron survival. The dopaminergic phenotype of the substantia
	nigral neurons was maintained over 2 weeks in culture as judged by
	immunoreactivity with antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase. During
	this time, immunoreactivity was found in the processes as they grew
	out from the soma. Together, these studies suggest that B27/Neurobasal
	will be a useful medium for maintaining the differentiated growth
	of neurons from many brain regions. Potential applications of a common
	growth medium for different neurons are discussed.},

  abstract = {The most interesting property of neurons is their long-distance propagation
	of signals as spiking action potentials. Since 1993, Neurobasal/B27
	has been used as a serum-free medium optimized for hippocampal neuron
	survival. Neurons on microelectrode arrays (MEA) were used as an
	assay system to increase spontaneous spike rates in media of different
	compositions. We find spike rates of 0.5 s(-1) (Hz) for rat embryonic
	hippocampal neurons cultured in Neurobasal/B27, lower than cultures
	in serum-based media and offering an opportunity for improvement.
	NbActiv4 was formulated by addition of creatine, cholesterol and
	estrogen to Neurobasal/B27 that synergistically produced an eightfold
	increase in spontaneous spike activity. The increased activity with
	NbActiv4 correlated with a twofold increase in immunoreactive synaptophysin
	bright puncta and GluR1 total puncta. Characteristic of synaptic
	scaling, immunoreactive GABAAbeta puncta also increased 1.5-fold
	and NMDA-R1 puncta increased 1.8-fold. Neuron survival in NbActiv4
	equaled that in Neurobasal/B27, but with slightly higher astroglia.
	Resting respiratory demand was decreased and demand capacity was
	increased in NbActiv4, indicating less stress and higher efficiency.
	These results show that NbActiv4 is an improvement to Neurobasal/B27
	for cultured networks with an increased density of synapses and transmitter
	receptors which produces higher spontaneous spike rates in neuron
	networks.},
