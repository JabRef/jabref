# `jablib` examples

## Maven

The subdirectory [`maven3`](maven3/) contains minimal Mavne-based projects showing the use of `jablib` in Java projects.

## JBang

[JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/) is a tooling in the Java eco system to enable single `.java` to be executed.
It fetches all declared dependencies and runs the whole package.

The subdirectory [`jbang`](jbang/) contains rather minimal `.java` files showing how `jablib` can be used in Java projects.
The code is intended as code-snippets to be used and modified as required.
