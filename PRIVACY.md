# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2023-08-24

Your privacy is a fundamental right JabRef e.V. respects and supports.
By using JabRef and its related online services, you choose to share some of your personal information.
In this Privacy Policy we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices you have.

The term 'Personal information' in this policy means any information that either directly identifies you or can be somehow linked to you. 'JabRef' refers to the desktop application that is provided by JabRef e.V.

Please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is absolute secure.
While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
Also, whenever you communicate through the internet, your IP-Address will always be transmitted and retained by third parties for technical and in some cases for legal reasons.

## JabRef Desktop Application

### Collecting information

JabRef does not collect any personal information directly linked to you.
However, on certain occasions JabRef will send some information to the online services of JabRef e.V.:

- On application start, JabRef will check for the latest version online (by default *enabled*).
- Information about a journal you are citing when looking for more information about this journal, using our journal database (by default *enabled*).
- A pdf document you automatically want to extract citation information from, using our GROBID service (by default *disabled*).
- Anonymized statistical data on the use of the graphical user interface for internal analysis purposes (by default *disabled*).

### Storing information

JabRef only stores the following personal information locally on your computer:

- Your proxy username and password, if you decide to store them (by default *disabled*).
- Any personal API key you use to access third party online services (by default *disabled*).

### Sharing information

Certain operations you perform in JabRef may trigger requests to public third-party services such as Zotero, Crossref or the Library of Congress for metadata retrieval.
These third parties may log additional information besides your IP address and the search terms (e.g., DOI, ISBN or the current URL) according to their privacy policies.

These third-party services are the following:
