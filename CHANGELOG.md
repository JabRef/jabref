## [5.7] - 2022-08-05

### Added

- We added a fetcher for [Biodiversity Heritage Library](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/). [8539](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8539)

- JabRef now writes log files. Linux: `$home/.cache/jabref/logs/version`, Windows: `%APPDATA%\..\Local\harawata\jabref\version\logs`, Mac: `Users/.../Library/Logs/jabref/version`
- We added an importer for Citavi backup files, support ".ctv5bak" and ".ctv6bak" file formats. [#8322](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8322)
- We added a feature to drag selected entries and drop them to other opened inactive library tabs [koppor521](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/521).

### Changed

- The file column in the main table now shows the corresponding defined icon for the linked file [8930](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8930).
- We improved the color of the selected entries and the color of the summary in the Import Entries Dialog in the dark theme. [#7927](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/7927)
- We upgraded to Lucene 9.2 for the fulltext search.
  Thus, the now created search index cannot be read from older versions of JabRef anylonger.
  ⚠️ JabRef will recreate the index in a new folder for new files and this will take a long time for a huge library.
  Moreover, switching back and forth JabRef versions and meanwhile adding PDFs also requires rebuilding the index now and then.
  [#8868](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8868)
- We improved the Latex2Unicode conversion [#8639](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8639)

- Writing BibTeX data into a PDF (XMP) does not write the `file` field.
- Writing BibTeX data into a PDF (XMP) considers the configured keyword separator (and does not use "," as default any more)
- The Medline/Pubmed search now also supports the [default fields and operators for searching](https://docs.jabref.org/collect/import-using-online-bibliographic-database#search-syntax). [forum#3554](https://discourse.jabref.org/t/native-pubmed-search/3354)

- We improved the message explaining the options when modifying an automatic keyword group [#8911](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8911)
- We moved the preferences option "Warn about duplicates on import" option from the tab "File" to the tab "Import and Export". [koppor#570](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/570)
- When JabRef encounters `% Encoding: UTF-8` header, it is kept during writing (and not removed). [#8964](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/8964)
- We replace characters which cannot be decoded using the specified encoding by a (probably another) valid character. This happens if JabRef detects the wrong charset (e.g., UTF-8 instead of Windows 1252). One can use the [Integrity Check](https://docs.jabref.org/finding-sorting-and-cleaning-entries/checkintegrity) to find those characters.

- We replaced the [OttoBib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OttoBib) fetcher by a fetcher by [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books). [#8652](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/8652)
