- We added a "Move file to file directory and rename file" option for simultaneously moving and renaming of document file. [#4166](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4166)
- Use integrated graphics card instead of discrete on macOS [#4070](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4070)
- We changed the minimum required version of Java to 1.8.0_171, as this is the latest release for which the automatic Java update works.  [4093](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/4093)
