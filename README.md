# JabRef

JabRef is a graphical application for managing bibliographical data.

* Homepage: http://jabref.sourceforge.net/
* Development page: https://github.com/JabRef
* Main git repository: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref

This repository has been generated out of the old git repository at sourceforge.
The folder  `jabref` of the old repository is now this repositry.
Although that changed **all** git commit ids, the advantage is to have a clean separation between plugins, the homepage and the code of JabRef.

### Bug tracker

The github tracker is the main bug tracker.

However, the "old" trackers at sourceforge still remain intact.

* Bugs: https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/
* Feature Requests: https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/feature-requests/

Do *not* file patches using https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/patches/.
Just fork JabRef and create a pull request.

### Next Steps

* Change build system from `ant` to `gradle` to get rid of the binaries in the repository.
* Migrate the sourceforge wiki to github
* Fix bugs listed at https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/bugs/.
