# JabRef Issue Collection

This repository is used by JabRef developers for discussing minor issues.
Reason: The main issue list at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues is growing constantly and we cannot keep it on one screen.
Nevertheless, we want to discuss minor issues and not left them unnoticed.

We understand "minor issues" as issues which require less than five hours of coding (including test cases).

The main code repository is still https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/.
The repository at https://github.com/koppor/jabref/ does not contain any code.
