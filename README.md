Want to be part of a free and open-source project that tens of thousands of scientists use every day?
Check out the ways you can contribute, below:

- Not a programmer? Help translating JabRef at [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/jabref) or learn how to help at [contribute.jabref.org](https://contribute.jabref.org)
- Quick overview on the architecture needed? Look at our [high-level documentation](https://devdocs.jabref.org/getting-into-the-code/high-level-documentation)
- For details on how to contribute, have a look at our [guidelines for contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- You are welcome to contribute new features. To get your code included into JabRef, just [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the JabRef repository, make your changes, and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests).
- To work on existing JabRef issues, check out our [issue tracker](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues). New to open source contributing? Look for issues with the ["good first issue"](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/labels/good%20first%20issue) label to get started.

We view pull requests as a collaborative process.
Submit a pull request early to get feedback from the team on work in progress.
We will discuss improvements with you and agree to merge them once the [developers](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/DEVELOPERS) approve.

If you want a step-by-step walk-through on how to set-up your workspace, please check [this guideline](https://devdocs.jabref.org/getting-into-the-code/guidelines-for-setting-up-a-local-workspace).

To compile JabRef from source, you need a Java Development Kit 14 and `JAVA_HOME` pointing to this JDK.
To run it, just execute `gradlew run`.
When you want to develop, it is necessary to generate additional sources using `gradlew generateSource`
and then generate the Eclipse `gradlew eclipse`.
For IntelliJ IDEA, just import the project via a Gradle Import by pointing at the `build.gradle`.

`gradlew test` executes all tests. We use [Github Actions](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/actions) for executing the tests after each commit. For developing, it is sufficient to locally only run the associated test for the classes you changed. Github will report any other failure.
