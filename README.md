# JabRef Simple Issue Collection

> JabRef's way of handling the mass of open issues.

The JabRef team faces many issues at <https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues> (nearly 200 as of 2019-09-25).
As developers of JabRef are picky about their product and want to improve it, too.
In case we noted all down at the main repository, they would become 400, if not 500.
Thus, we collect our issues in this repository.

Some of the issues are rather simple ones and a good start for newcomers.
Some issues are describing the bright future of JabRef if the developers had much more time.

Everyone is invited to comment on an issue here or just start working on one.

When fixing an issue, please follow [CONTRIBUTING.md of JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
