### Background

JabRef is a graphical Java application for editing [BibTeX] and [Biblatex] `.bib` databases.
JabRef lets you organize your entries into overlapping logical groups, and with a single click limit your view to a single group or an intersection or union of several groups.
You can customize the entry information shown in the main window, and sort by any of the standard BibTeX fields.
JabRef can autogenerate BibTeX keys for your entries.
JabRef also lets you easily link to PDF or web sources for your reference entries.

JabRef can import from and export to several formats, and you can customize export filters.
JabRef can be run as a command line application to convert from any import format to any export format.

## Building JabRef From Source

If you want a step-by-step tutorial, please check [this guideline](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Guidelines-for-setting-up-a-local-workspace)

To compile JabRef from source, you need a Java compiler supporting Java 1.8 and `JAVA_HOME` pointing to this JDK.
You have to set `GRADLE_OPTS` to `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` as [gradle uses the JVM's platform encoding](https://discuss.gradle.org/t/is-there-a-way-to-tell-gradle-to-read-gradle-build-scripts-using-a-specified-encoding/7535).

To run it, just execute `gradlew run`.
When you want to develop, it is necessary to generate additional sources using `gradlew generateSource`
and then generate the Eclipse `gradlew eclipse`.
For IntelliJ IDEA, just import the project via a Gradle Import by pointing at the `build.gradle`.


## Testing

`gradlew test` executes the normal unit tests.
If you want to test the UI, execute `gradlew integrationTest`.
Sources for the integration test are kept in `src/integrationTest`.


## Release Process

Building a release requires [install4j]. We've got an [Open Source License](https://www.ej-technologies.com/buy/install4j/openSource).
Releasing is done using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/JabRef/jabref). A full release howto is available [in our wiki](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/wiki/Releasing-a-new-Version).
