  abstract        = {The rapid development of digital technology has a profound impact on the social economy, which is a significant sign that the society has entered into the digital age. Digital technology promotes the popularization and promotion of digital education while enabling education. Under this background, the European Union in 2020 issued the Digital Action Plan (2021-2027) at the end of September 2020, pointing out that the integration of digital technology and education is the general trend of the digital age. It is also pointed the development direction and priority actions for the digital transformation of education, and provides policy guidance for the digital transformation of vocational education. Based on the interpretation of the plan proposed by the European Union, and through the statistics and comparative analysis of the running data about vocational education in recent years, to discuss and combine with the digital education plan, the formation of high-quality and inclusive vocational education is in urgent need. Therefore, vocational education in the digital age need to constantly improve the digital capabilities of talents and promote the digital transformation of vocational education, so as to match the rapidly changing economics structure and the skill demand changed in the labor market.},

When Austria implemented the mandatory curriculum “Digital Education” in September 2018 for all students in lower secondary education, digital literacy finally found its official way into additional grades. The curriculum covers digital competences, media competences, as well as civic education. Schools can decide if they offer stand-alone subjects or if they implement the curriculum in an integrative way in several other subjects. This paper reports on first experiences with the new curriculum by evaluating a survey conducted approximately two years after the implementation. Aiming to do so, the qualitative data were interpreted, summarized, and discussed, while the quantitative data were analyzed in former papers. The study was sent to 133 local public schools, whereas 117 teachers were willing to complete the questionnaire and 39 filled out the comment section. The following research questions lay out the basis for the evaluation of the qualitative data: 1) How do teachers manage the implementation of the new curriculum? 2) What is the teachers' opinion on the current situation? The results we present in this paper suggest that there are still people who fight with the new subject and that there are various problems that have to be tackled. Still, the attitude towards the current situation of the new curriculum is very positive.},

  abstract        = {The recent Covid-19 pandemic has created a strong momentum for educational institutions across the world to transform their digital education. While online learning has its benefits and is valuable for distance and adult learning, there are several known limitations in terms of overall student satisfaction, social connectivity, student well-being, cost of transformation, student and faculty preparedness, and challenges in converting certain learning activities such as hands-on experiments and labs to be online. Our university, Singapore University of Technology and Design, uses signature student-centric pedagogies characterized by an interdisciplinary curriculum, learning and teaching in teams, design-centric project work, and assessments. This includes both Pre-employment Training (PET) and Continuing Education and Training (CET). Although existing technologies such as Zoom and TEAMS can be adapted easily for self-directed online courses such as MOOCs, the question is "How can we possibly use technology for student-centric teaching which involves interdisciplinary curriculum, and hands-on collaborative projects?" This requires both bottom-up and top-down changes in the university-level strategies for teaching and learning. Faculty members need to innovate teaching and learning, and university leadership, together with support services must strategize and present a sharp vision, clear directions, and supportive resources for moving this forward. To this end, our university has launched a campus-wide program to spur technology innovation for the ever-changing norm of teaching and learning. In this reflection paper, we will share our campusX initiative which focuses on cyber-physical learning to innovating digital learning.},

Five technical challenges are identified and analyzed: (1) information and communication technology infrastructure, (2) interoperability, (3) development of artificial intelligence algorithms to aid education, (4) implementation, (5) security, data protection and privacy. A framework is proposed to synthesize the results of the analysis performed, reflecting the technical challenges identified and solution approaches.},

In this paper, we conduct web crawling written in Python to systematically scan the Web of Science to retrieve the related literature. Based on 646 bibliographic data collected from the database, the findings show that the main contribution has been made by mostly the three main disciplines: science education, educational research, and engineering, the top journals such as International Journal of Engineering Education, the top keywords such as accreditation, assessment, quality assurance, outcomes, etc. The findings also reveal how such concerns have been discussed in relation to topics such as learning analytics, big data, sustainability, impacts, etc., that can be related to green and digital transformation. In conclusion, the overall mapping provides an initial roadmap for the practice of higher education assessment and accreditation to harness the potentials of digital technologies for green and digital transformation of higher education, including more inclusive notion of "impact" that includes sustainability and more human-centered notion of "outcomes" that focuses more on human development.},
