  abstract   = {"Uniquely intertwining the stories of three leading early twentieth century radical Americans, this book presents the enthralling tale of the too-short lives of Inez Milholland, Randolph Bourne and John Reed. This collective biography highlights the movements, causes and personal experiences that drew such privileged individuals to the American left, willing to sacrifice comfortable circumstances and opportunities. Operating as writers and activists, the trio became leading spokespersons for feminism, sexual liberation, unions, civil liberties, pacifism, internationalism, socialism, anarchism and, in Reed's case, communism. Determinedly challenging capitalism, patriarchy and the nation-state, the independently-minded Milholland, Bourne and Reed possessed a twofold commitment to personal liberation and community-interclass and transnational. With their early deaths, they left behind personal models for acting, living, thinking afresh and standing as cultural and political radicals in early twentieth century America. In the process, they became martyrs to the very movements they championed."-Provided by publisher"},
