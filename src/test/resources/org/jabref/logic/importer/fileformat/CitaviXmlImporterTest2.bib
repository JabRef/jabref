Political Aid and Arab Activism examines transnational programs in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Yemen, Lebanon, Tunisia, Algeria, the exceptional cases of Palestine and Iraq, and the Arab region at large during two tumultuous decades. To understand the controversial and contraadictory effects of pGlitical aid, Sheila Carapico analyzes discursive and professional practices in four key subfields: the rule of law, electoral design and monitoring, women's political empowerment, and civil society. From the institutional arrangements for extraordinary underrtakings such as Saddam Hussein's trial or Palestinian elections to routine templates for national women's machineries or NGO nettworks, her research explores the paradoxes and jurisdictional disputes confronted by Arab activists for justice, representation, and "nonngovernmental" agency.--},

  comment = {# Their description of civil society

"Civil society activism in Lebanon has the standard feature of being largely divided between a social sector and a more political one. thus there are a significant number of service-provision associations and groups. (...) The more politicized sector is also active and significantly more outspoken than anywhere else in the Arab world. There are a number of large and well-functioning civil society groups working on democratization and human rights issues. When it comes to this sector, there are two strong trends. The first is related to the prevalence of sectarianism in Lebanese society. Given that the most significant feature of the Lebanese political and social system is indeed its sectarianism, it is not a surprise that civil society activism reflects this sectarian divide. Many organizations, even those engaged in human rights and democracy issues, often subscribe to the political agenda of one particular sect, although not necessarily formally so. [NO REFERNECE! ABSOLUTELY NO REFERENCE!] There is however a second trend  that has been growing for a number of years which realtes to the work of associations attempting to build what can be termed a nationalist Lebanese activist sector.Driven by the belief that domestic conflicts and international interference are the product of weak Lebanese nationalism and sense//of belonging to a Lebanese state, a number of organizations have recently emerged attempting to overcome sectarian barriers. THis entails working for the promotion of genuine democratic accountability, which would see the progressive replacement of the sectarian political system with one based on individual representation. Following the same logic, a number of organizations have emerged with the objectives of reducing sectarianism enshrined in legislation and building bridges through post-conflict resolution and reconciliation. (Safa, 2007)" 
As "representative" of this development, they describe in detail LADE
Lebanese Association for HUman Rights (LAHR) or ALDHOM? is the second example. I have no clue who they are, they don't seem to be in the picture anymore? They have a facebook page with  21 likes https://www.facebook.com/Lebanese-Association-for-Human-Rights-284544538248613/
There's a beautiful description of the triple-orientation of intermediaries/leaders/people in that field: politicians - civil society - international community. 125
I just doN't know why LAHR shoudl have more problems with political class then LADE. Because they are more staunchly anti-sectarian?
AMEL is the next organisation. They also mention and describe at length an organisation called MIRSAD. Then they summarize and move on to the René Mouawad Foundation. 
About RMF they amongst other things say that in order to do their lobbying for children's educational rights for example, they have to mobilize their contacts to decision makers which inevitably are in the Maronite community. which "reinforces rather than weakens sectarian divisions." 129
on page 130 they move on to a committee working on disappeared, and a "Center" but guiven that pages 131-132 are missing from google books, I can't tell which one...
133 "Palestinian civil society", Palestinian Association for HUman Rights 
p. 135 compares the situation to other Arab countries, coming to the conclusion that a "fully-fledged dictatorship" is impossible because of "the necessity for compromise between the sects in order to manage the country" 135, and that also the space for civil society is larger;
then this sectarian logic of power finds its reflection in citizen's orientation and in also in the networks of power that civil society can mobilize for their lobbying. 135 Also, it invites external actors, "In this game, the Lebanese sects also use external patrons in order to gain domestic advantages. This has considerable repercussions on how civil society is structured and the issues dealt with, leading to divisions and difficulties of coordination."

- she takes this market idea seriously and follows through with what it means analytically
- Her claim is that economics has two persepectives on it:
research on charitable giving: charity - but ignores organisational aspect 44
research on non-profit firms: non-profit as organizations - but ignores the charity aspect
- donors are the buyers, not the other way round
- NGOs are not neutral conduits of anything
- following Hansmann (1980) relief NGOs are described as donnative and non-mutual, meaning that its income stems from donations (not business?) and that it is not primarily members that benefit (other than in a club) 46-47
- A market in which the buyer  is not the consumer (charity etc.): "The market may reflect preferences of buyers more accurately than the preferences of the end consumers." 47 Her examples here are a landlord hiring an exterminator or employer providing health insurance and negotiating the contract. But in the field of charity, there is no legal framework!!!! super important realisation. 47
Plus: donor does not only decide about the goods but also selects the consumer. (I'd however say this is - with a different sequencing also true for the landlord or the employer.) 
- "What is being consumed by donors are not pots and pans or tents or food, but the act of giving. This should invite us to rethink our expectations about the organization's process of planning, production, and marketing." 47

But with so many ailing areas in need of assistance, how do these organizations decide where to go{u2014}and who gets the aid? In The Good Project, Monika Krause dives into the intricacies of the decision-making process at NGOs and uncovers a basic truth: It may be the case that relief agencies try to help people but, in practical terms, the main focus of their work is to produce projects. Agencies sell projects to key institutional donors, and in the process the project and its beneficiaries become commodities. In an effort to guarantee a successful project, organizations are incentivized to help those who are easy to help, while those who are hardest to help often receive no assistance at all. The poorest of the world are made to compete against each other to become projects{u2014}and in exchange they offer legitimacy to aid agencies and donor governments. Sure to be controversial, The Good Project offers a provocative new perspective on how NGOs succeed and fail on a local and global level. --Provided by publisher.},

Or, like Axel Honneth, we may reflect on recognition theory as a means of addressing social problems. Whatever our objective, the focus of critical theory continues to be the consciousness of established "positive" interests that, without debate, may sustain injustices or conditions which the public may not have chosen to impose. Throughout the hardship of punitive dismissal and exile in the 1930s and 40s, and the shock of the New Left in the 1960s and 70s, and finally the later linguistic and pragmatic turn, the Frankfurt School has sustained the idea that people escape disaffection and alienation when their knowledge of the social and political world is dialectically mediated through creative interaction.

This book offers insight into the intricate relations between the workings of governing and (the possibility for) people's agency on the one hand, and about the possible effects of our attempts to engage in such studies on the other. In numerous ways, and from different starting points, the contributions to this volume provide thoughtful insights into, and creative suggestions for, how to work with the methodological challenges of studying the agency of being governed.

"Wirklichkeit wird, fundiert in selbstverständlichten Rekursen auf je Überkommenes, stets aufs Neue durch aufeinander bezogene Handlungen gesellschaftlich konstruiert. So betrachtet, rückt der Handlungsbegriff ins Zentrum des sozialwissenschaftlichen Interesses - ein Handlungsbegriff, der sich gleich zweifach auf den Akteur bezieht: Einmal versteht er ihn als selbstreflexives Subjekt, das in der alltäglichen Aneignung soziale Wissensbestände ausdeutet und sie prüft, sie differenziert oder zusammenfasst. ZUm anderen versteht er ihn als Adressaten von Wissensbeständen und darin eingelassenen Wertungen."

She also, in a differnet context, where an NGO had promised to help and act as a broker, pulled out and left behind a community that "had been put in a position where they coud expect someone else to stand up for them, instead of developing self-organiding collective capacity." 112 encountered that people's first question was: "what I would do for them" - so "her identity as a researcher was conflated with  that of an external agent in a position to 'help'." 112
the third encounter she terms "encountering empowerment": a social movement that has been succesfful and is very willing to share their stories and educate her about their experiences 112-113
