T1  - Release profile of ibuprofen in β-cyclodextrin complexes from two different solid dosage forms.
N2  - The objective of this work was to develop solid dosage forms using powders contg. inclusion complexes (ibuprofen with β-cyclodextrin) which were used to produce tablets (direct compression without addnl. excipients) and pellets (extrusion/spheronization) from wet mass contg. 40% (wt./wt.) of microcryst. cellulose.  The pellets also demonstrated that during prepn. of the wet mass, the inclusion process occurred in a same yield that when pre-complexation was used.  The particles characteristics were evaluated after being obtained through different complexation methods.  The results showed that the tensile strength and profile dissoln. were as expected for both dosage forms.  Tablets contg. inclusion complexes showed higher soly. when compared with a ref. formulation and with two com. formulations.  The ibuprofen released from the two pellets formulations didn't show relevant differences between them.  The drug released was analyzed considering different dissoln. parameters.  The advantages of these new methodologies can be summarized as: (a) tablets were produced at a lower cost for the total process; and (b) in the pellet's prepn. there was no need of the previous complexation method resulting in a decrease in time and energy required.
