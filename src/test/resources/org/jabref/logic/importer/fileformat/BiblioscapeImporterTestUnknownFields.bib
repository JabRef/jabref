  abstract = {Protein 4.1 is an 80-kD structural component of the red blood cell (RBC) cytoskeleton.It is critical for the formation of the spectrin/actin/protein 4.1 junctional complex, the integrity of which is important for the horizontal strength and elasticity of RBCs.We and others have previously shown that multiple protein 4.1 mRNA isoforms are generated from a single genomic locus by several alternative mRNA splicing events, leading to the insertion or skipping of discrete internal sequence motifs. The physiologic significance of these motifs},
