# Advantages of RFID

"With RFID, drugs can be tracked at the item level throughout the supply chain. Individual packages are tagged at manufacturing and then read serially, in-bulk throughout the distribution chain. The read points include tag application, case packaging, total tracking throughout distribution and item level tracking and authentication at the pharmacy. With RFID, the entire drug supply chain becomes more efficient and secure."

  abstract = {Background: Food legislation in the European Union and elsewhere includes both hazard- and risk-based approaches for ensuring safety. In hazard-based approaches, simply the presence of a potentially harmful agent at a detectable level in food is used as a basis for legislation and/or risk management action. Riskbased approaches allow consideration of exposure in assessing whether there may be unacceptable risks to health. Scope and approach: The advantages and disadvantages of hazard- and risk-based approaches for ensuring the safety of food chemicals, allergens, ingredients and microorganisms were explored at an ILSI Europe workshop. Key findings and conclusions: It was concluded that both types of approach have their place, depending on the context. However, problems can arise when both types of approach are used in regulation by separate agencies that address different aspects of the same agent/substance present in food. This separation of decision-making can result in hazard-based restrictions on marketing and use, whereas risk-based assessments for those exposed show there is reasonable certainty no harm will result. This in turn can lead to contradictory, confusing and ultimately unnecessary actions. Use of hazard-based approaches for foods also means that comparisons with benefits for nutrition and food security cannot be undertaken. This has the potential to lead to bias in the overall conclusions of regulators and risk managers, who may not have been presented with the benefits of particular foods. The value of riskbased approaches is becoming increasingly recognised.},

  title    = {Economically motivated adulteration},
  abstract = {The food supply system is vulnerable to various types of contamination and adulteration. This research focuses on economically motivated adulteration (often called "food fraud"). Economically motivated adulteration (EMA) refers to the knowingly selling a food product that is not up to standards in order to gain economic advantage. There is a long history of EMA in a wide variety of food products. The food safety paradigm is not sufficient for food defense, or for prevention and deterrence of EMA. The goal of this research was to develop methods to improve capabilities for preventing and detecting EMA incidents. First, the food ingredient monographs in the United States Pharmacopeial (USP) Convention Food Chemicals Codex (FCC) were evaluated for susceptibility to EMA. These evaluations can be used to help target the most susceptible ingredients for monograph modernization within USP, and for inspection and laboratory testing resources by regulatory agencies. Second, economic and production data for dairy products in China leading up to the melamine adulteration event was analyzed to evaluate the utility of this data for alerting to the potential for EMA in a food commodity. This analysis shed insight on variables that may be useful for tracking the production of global commodities for early indications of EMA. Finally, a surveillance technique for trade data was evaluated using melamine adulteration of wheat gluten as a case study. This biosurveillance-like methodology can be applied to food import data to identify supply chain shifts that could indicate changes in the market for food products and a heightened risk of EMA. Regulatory agencies have an enormous burden of responsibility for regulating the food supply for both domestically-produced and imported food products. Given the constrained resources of these agencies, they need improved methods for targeting those resources towards the riskiest food products. These preliminary efforts to shed light on EMA vulnerabilities and potential mitigation efforts can contribute to efforts in that area. An integrated, systems-based approach to food protection that encompasses both food safety and food defense is imperative for ensuring the integrity of our food supply.},

  comment  = {# Definition of food fraud (Hong et al)

“The key characteristics of food fraud are noncompliance with food laws and/or misleading the consumer, intentional fraud, and the purpose of financial gain.”



# Typical kinds of adulterated foods

“In general, foods and food ingredients commonly associated with food fraud include oil, fish, honey, milk and dairy products, meat products, grain-based foods, fruit juices, wine and alcoholic beverages, organic foods, spices, coffee, tea, and some highly processed foods.”



# Mass spectrometry is the type of testing used for most types of food

“A notable observation is that MS is used extensively in most food categories, and is also the most frequently used method in the analysis of spices, extracts, cereals, grains, and pulses.”



# Most common detection method by food category

“Detection methods were ranked according to their number of uses in the literature. MS accounted for the largest proportion at 20.6%; PCR for 18.5%, and LC for 11.6%. MS also accounted for the greatest proportion in Asian countries and South Korea (20.7% and 38.1%, respectively). A notable observation is that MS is used extensively in most food categories, and is also the most frequently used method in the analysis of spices, extracts, cereals, grains, and pulses. However, LC and GC are also used to a significant degree for spices, oils, and organic foods. NMR is used frequently to discriminate the authenticity of oils, cereals, grains, alcoholic beverages and fruit juices. PCR is the predominant detection technology used for the food categories of meat and meat products, fish and seafood, and milk and milk products. In addition to MS, HPLC and LC are often used for fruits, fruit juices, and sweeteners. IR spectroscopy, Raman, immunosorbent assays (e.g., ELISA), and biosensors are used less when compared with the other detection methods.”



# Four categories used when authenticating meat

“Authentication problems with respect to meat and meat products are grouped into four major categories: meat species, meat processing treatment (cooked meat, and fresh versus thawed meat), meat geographic origin, and non-meat ingredient addition (additives and water).”



# DNA-based techniques most popular for meat authentication testing

“The most common methodologies used to determine the authenticity of meat and meat products are unquestionably DNA-based techniques: real-time PCR, multiplex PCR, and species-specific PCR.”



# Meat usually adulterated with pork and testing can be an issue to detect if the meat is minced or processed

“A frequent adulteration of meat products is the addition of pork to beef products, which is done for economic gain. Particularly for minced and homogenized meat products, the development of a method to identify species is an important authenticity issue.”



# How fish and seafood are typically adulterated

“Forms of fish and seafood fraud include intentionally increasing the product weight and using illegal additives in production. Methods to increase weight include adding excess water to frozen product (overglazing), soaking products such as scallops in sodium tripolyphosphate so that they retain water, and overbreading.”

Regulation in the food industry involves a relationship between regulators and members of the industry, and it is imperative that these relationships are built on trust. Research has shown in a variety of contexts that businesses find the most success when there are high levels of trust between them and their key stakeholders. An evidence-based understanding of the barriers to communication and trust is imperative if we are to put forward recommendations for facilitating the (re)building of trusting and communicative relationships. METHODS: We present data from 72 interviews with regulators and industry representatives regarding their trust in and communication with one another. Interviews were conducted in the UK, New Zealand, and Australia in 2013. RESULTS: Data identify a variety of factors that shape the dynamic and complex relationships between regulators and industry, as well as barriers to communication and trust between the two parties. Novel in our approach is our emphasis on identifying solutions to these barriers from the voices of industry and regulators. CONCLUSIONS: We provide recommendations (e.g., development of industry advisory boards) to facilitate the (re)building of trusting and communicative relationships between the two parties.},

# Most often food fraud is not likely to cause health problems, but it does lead to lower quality food

“The common factor in many cases of food fraud, is that the adulterant is neither a food safety hazard, nor readily identified (as this would defeat the aim of the fraudster). Common adulterants include water and sugar, or ingredients that may be legitimately used and declared, but whose improper use constitutes fraud. Food fraud deceives the consumers by providing them with lower quality foodstuff, against their knowledge and will.”

page range: 4

# Steps for prevention

“A general approach to prevent food fraud can be summarised as follows: 
• Conduct vulnerability assessment, including: 
– Know your materials and risks (history, economic factors, geographical origins, physical state, emerging issues); 
– Know your suppliers (manufacturer, broker, history);
 – Know your supply chain (length, complexity, supply & demand arrangements, ease of access);
 – Know your existing control measures. 
• Design mitigation strategy and implement mitigation measures. 
• Validate and verify mitigation measures, continually review food fraud management system.”

page range: 6

# Factors that can contribute to fraud

“Factors such as the demand for a specific ingredient (volume), the extent of its use (ingredient used in several products and businesses), or the market price fluctuation may contribute to an increased level of vulnerability to fraud.”

page range: 6

# Increases in prices for an ingredient and rarity are good conditions for fraud

“Any anomaly in the economics of particular raw material sources is an indicator of the raw material potential vulnerability. Drastic increases in market price and scarce supplies of a raw material (e.g. poor harvest following bad weather, or caused by a new parasite) are good indicators of increased raw material vulnerability based on economic anomalies.”

page range: 8

# Geopolitical considerations

“Geopolitical considerations are also important to characterise vulnerability to food fraud. A country-specific low price compared with the rest of the market may indicate a lack of food control and/or regulatory/enforcement framework in the country of origin (or any other country through which the ingredient may transit).”

“Raw material monitoring should be performed using appropriate analytical methods for the verification of authenticity. The methods must be selective, specific, and of appropriate sensitivity to verify that the food authenticity process is efficient. There are 2 approaches:
 • Targeted analyses (linked to parameters specified in raw material specifications);
 • Untargeted techniques (fingerprinting) that assess the raw material integrity against adulteration.”

# Businesses should use suppliers they can trust and who will share processes with them

“Confidence is increased with a supplier’s readiness to share information on their supply chain and processes. This is why the development of trusted suppliers (rather than continuous rotation) is important in mitigating the risk of food fraud. The closer the relationship, the lower the risk.”

# Auditing examples

“More targeted examination may be carried out by auditors during audits at a specific raw material production/handling site. For example on a meat production site – auditors may detect the presence of unapproved flavours, dyes or preservatives in the production and/or storage areas. On a poultry production site – auditors may look for the presence of equipment used to inject brine.”

# Definition of EMA (economically-motivated adulteration)

“EMA is the intentional sale of substandard food products or ingredients for the purpose of economic gain. Common types of EMA include substitution or dilution of an authentic ingredient with a cheaper product (such as replacing extra virgin olive oil with a cheaper oil), flavour or colour enhancement using illicit or unapproved substances (such as unapproved dyes), and substitution of one species with another (such as fish species fraud).”

# Recommendations for consumers for avoiding food fraud

“Whole, unprocessed foods (such as unground coffee and spices, or whole fruits instead of juice) are more difficult to adulterate, therefore buying these foods may offer some reassurance with regards to fraud. As for processed foods, it is a good idea to buy from reputable sources and brands that have a vested interest in protecting their reputation.”

The resulting free range and organic meat products retail at a higher price, but are difficult to differentiate from their counterparts. To ascertain authenticity and prevent fraud, relevant markers need to be identified and new analytical methodology developed. The objective of this pilot study was to characterize pork belly meats of different animal welfare classes by their fatty acid (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester-FAME), non-volatile compound (electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry-ESI-MS/MS), and volatile compound (proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry-PTR-MS) fingerprints. Well-defined pork belly meat samples (13 conventional, 15 free range, and 13 organic) originating from the Netherlands were subjected to analysis. Fingerprints appeared to be specific for the three categories, and resulted in 100%, 95.3%, and 95.3% correct identity predictions of training set samples for FAME, ESI-MS/MS, and PTR-MS respectively and slightly lower scores for the validation set. Organic meat was also well discriminated from the other two categories with 100% success rates for the training set for all three analytical approaches. Ten out of 25 FAs showed significant differences in abundance between organic meat and the other categories, free range meat differed significantly for 6 out of the 25 FAs. Overall, FAME fingerprinting presented highest discrimination power.},

Fake foods are in our supermarkets, our restaurants, and our kitchen cabinets. Award-winning food journalist and travel writer Larry Olmsted exposes the pervasive and dangerous fraud perpetrated on unsuspecting Americans. Real Food/Fake Food brings readers into the unregulated food industry, revealing the alarming truth: What we think we're eating is not what we're really eating. Olmsted examines how this shocking deception extends from high-end foods like olive oil, wine, and Kobe beef to everyday staples such as coffee, honey, juice, and cheese. It's a massive bait and switch where counterfeiting is rampant and where the consumer ultimately pays the price. But Olmstead does more than show us what foods to avoid. A bona fide gourmand, he travels to the sources of the real stuff, to help us recognize what to look for, eat, and enjoy. Genuine Parmigiano-Reggiano from Italy, fresh-caught grouper from Florida, authentic port from Portugal. Real foods that are grown, raised, produced, and prepared with care by masters of their craft. Part cautionary tale, part culinary crusade, Real Food/Fake Food is addictively readable, mouth-wateringly enjoyable, and utterly relevant. Larry Olmsted convinces us why real food matters},

  abstract = {Food fraud, including the more defined subcategory ofeconomically motivated adulteration, is a food risk that is gaining recognition and concern. Regardless ofthe cause ofthe food risk, adulteration offood is both an industry and a government responsibility. Food safety, food fraud, and food defense incidents can create adulteration offood with public health threats. Food fraud is an intentional act for economic gain, whereas a food safety incident is an unintentional act with unintentional harm, and a food defense incident is an intentional act with intentional harm. Economically motivated adulteration may be just that—economically motivated—but the food-related public health risks are often more risky than traditional food safety threats because the contaminants are unconventional. Current intervention systems are not designed to look for a near infinite number ofpotential contaminants. The authors developed the core concepts reported here following comprehensive research ofarticles and reports, expert elicitation, and an extensive peer review. The intent of this research paper is to provide a base reference document for defining food fraud—it focuses specifically on the public health threat—and to facilitate a shift in focus from intervention to prevention. This will subsequently provide a framework for future quantitative or innovative research. The fraud opportunity is deconstructed using the criminology and behavioral science applications ofthe crime triangle and the chemistry ofthe crime. The research provides a food risk matrix and identifies food fraud incident types. This project provides a starting point for future food science, food safety, and food defense research.},

Food Fraud is intentional with no intent to harm but only for economic gain. As with improving Food Safety and Food Defense, preventing Food Fraud is good for society and the economy. Society benefits through fewer public health threats from unauthorized acts. Society also benefits from increased consumer satisfaction and harmony. Food Security is increased through the production of more, higher-value products for consumers, commerce, and exporting.

The adulteration of roasted coffee is a strategy used to reduce costs. Conventional methods employed to identify adulteration in roasted and ground coffee involve optical and electron microscopy, which require pretreatment of samples and are time-consuming and subjective. Other analytical techniques have been studied that might be more reliable, reproducible, and widely applicable. The present review provides an overview of three analytical approaches (physical, chemical, and biological) to the identification of coffee adulteration. A total of 30 published articles are considered. It is concluded that despite the existence of a number of excellent studies in this area, there still remains a lack of a suitably sensitive and widely applicable methodology able to take into account the various different aspects of adulteration, considering coffee varieties, defective beans, and external agents.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a comprehensive categorisation of food scares. Design/methodology/approach – Following an initial desktop study, the categorisation was developed collaboratively with industry experts through a workshop and series of semi-structured interviews. Findings – The new categorisation developed is in Venn diagram format allowing overlapping categories. It is organised around the two major types of contamination (biological, and chemical/physical contaminants) and the two major causes of contamination (wilful deception, and transparency and awareness issues). Practical implications – The long and complex supply chains characteristic of current food production systems have resulted in a rising number of food scares. There is thus an increased emphasis on developing strategies to reduce both the number of incidents of food scares, and their associated economic, social and environmental impacts. The new categorisation developed in this study enables experts to address categories of food scares. Inclusion of the cause of contamination is particularly important as the method through which contamination occurs is key in devising food scare prevention strategies. Originality/value – The new categorisation, unlike previous categorisations, enables food scares to fall into multiple categories, as appropriate. Also, again in contrast to previous categorisations, it takes into account not only the physical problem of a food scare but also the mechanism through which it arises.},
