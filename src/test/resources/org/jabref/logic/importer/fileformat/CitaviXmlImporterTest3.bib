  abstract  = {From the Inside Flap Any conversation about effective teaching must begin with a consideration of how students learn. However, instructors may find a gap between resources that focus on the technical research on learning and those that provide practical classroom strategies. How Learning Works provides the bridge for such a gap. In this volume, the authors introduce seven general principles of learning, distilled from the research literature as well as from twenty-seven years of experience working one-on-one with college faculty. They have drawn on research from a breadth of perspectives (cognitive, developmental, and social psychology; educational research; anthropology; demographics; and organizational behavior) to identify a set of key principles underlying learning-from how effective organization enhances retrieval and use of information to what impacts motivation. These principles provide instructors with an understanding of student learning that can help them see why certain teaching approaches are or are not supporting student learning, generate or refine teaching approaches and strategies that more effectively foster student learning in specific contexts, and transfer and apply these principles to new courses. For anyone who wants to improve his or her students' learning, it is crucial to understand how that learning works and how to best foster it. This vital resource is grounded in learning theory and based on research evidence, while being easy to understand and apply to college teaching.},

New descriptions of information literacy, that may be of value to the business sector, are now beginning to appear as a result of qualitative research into how professional employees experience the effective use of information. This paper summarises the outcomes of an investigation into the experience of information literacy amongst various types of professionals; and explores the possible differences and interrelations between individual and organisational information literacy suggested by these outcomes. Seven different ways of experiencing information literacy were identified. These experiences are closely related to important workplace processes such as environmental scanning, information management, corporate memory, and research and development; confirming that information literacy should be considered a significant part of the character of learning organisations as well as being a key characteristic of the organisation's employees. Implications of individual and organisational information literacy for beginning and continuing professional education are explored.},

Methods used for evaluating information skills include scoring features of literature searches and user satisfaction surveys. DISCUSSION Privileged contacts between librarians and faculty resulting from embedded LI as well as from active participation in library committees result in a growing reputation of library services across academic departments and bring forth collaboration opportunities. Sustainability and evolution of the LI programme is warranted by frequent communication with partners in the clinical field, active involvement in academic networks and health library associations, and reflective professional strategies.},

However, few measures of scientific literacy are available to assess students' proficiency in using scientific literacy skills to solve scenarios in and beyond the undergraduate biology classroom. In this paper, we describe the development, validation, and testing of the Test of Scientific Literacy Skills (TOSLS) in five general education biology classes at three undergraduate institutions. The test measures skills related to major aspects of scientific literacy: recognizing and analyzing the use of methods of inquiry that lead to scientific knowledge and the ability to organize, analyze, and interpret quantitative data and scientific information. Measures of validity included correspondence between items and scientific literacy goals of the National Research Council and Project 2061, findings from a survey of biology faculty, expert biology educator reviews, student interviews, and statistical analyses. Classroom testing contexts varied both in terms of student demographics and pedagogical approaches. We propose that biology instructors can use the TOSLS to evaluate their students' proficiencies in using scientific literacy skills and to document the impacts of curricular reform on students' scientific literacy.},

The research focus is on group members’ activities and cognitive and emotional experiences during the task process of writing an assignment. It is investigated if group members’ information behavior differ from the individual information seeker in the ISP-model and to what extent this behavior is influenced by contextual (work task) and social (group work) factors. Three groups of LIS students were followed during a 14 weeks period in 2004/2005 (10 participants). Quantitative and qualitative methods were employed, such as demographic surveys, process surveys, diaries and interviews. Similarities in behavior were found between group members and the individual in Kuhlthau’s ISP-model with regard to the general stages of information seeking, the cognitive pattern associated with focus formulation and the tendency towards an increase in writing activities while searching activities decreased. Differences in behavior were also found, which were associated with contextual and social factors beyond the mere search process. It is concluded that the ISP-model does not fully comply with group members’ problem solving process and the involved information seeking behavior. Further, complex academic problem solving seems to be even more complex when it is performed in a group based setting. The study contributes with a new conceptual understanding of students’ behavior in small groups.},

Key developments in the UK, USA and Australia are reviewed, including standards and models of information literacy. The place of information literacy in the higher education curriculum is discussed. Problems with current practice are identified, in particular, prescriptive guidelines which encourage a surface learning approach; delivery by librarians who may lack both educational training and power to influence the curriculum; and poor assessment methods. Alternative approaches are highlighted. A case study of a credit bearing information literacy class, offered by the authors to undergraduates at Strathclyde Business School, is analysed, to argue that information literacy can stand alone as a subject of study, with appropriate learning and teaching methods. The article concludes by proposing models for the information literate student and the information literate university.},

Shows that computer-aided learning approaches to user education have great strengths but also undeniable weaknesses. The way to promote higher levels of information literacy in the electronic library environment is to increase the levels of computer-led delivery, as long as this is done in such a way as to maximise the strengths of the format. This is best done in the context of an integrated virtual learning environment (VLE). Such an environment would promote information literacy synergistically as one of a suite of multiple electronic literacies that can be learnt alongside each other. Exploiting a VLE in this way would also facilitate the integration of information literacy into the broader curriculum. Computer-based user education to date could be viewed as having been constrained by a need to imitate well-established, tutor-delivered user education methods. Without an ambitious programme of integration into larger scale e-learning models, this pattern of constraint will continue.},

Practical implications - By defining concepts clearly, this paper attempts to inform and clarify the framework for practical LIS research. Originality/value - In contrast to other discussions (which tend to focus either on eLiteracy, or on Information Literacy) this editorial squarely addresses criticism of the eL concept in comparison to IL.

The survey is the first phase of a study exploring the actual and potential role of Canadian public libraries in developing the public's IL skills. Despite an urgent need to develop such skills, and expectations that public libraries fulfill that role (specifically articulated by the federal government through its “Connecting Canadians” initiative), the real experiences of public librarians and of public library customers may not bear out this expectation. The survey analyzes the role of the public library, as a non-profit institution and primary stakeholder, in advancing federal government information policy. In addition, the study gives voice to a community of professionals expected to fulfill an important federal policy function, but provided with few resources with which to do so.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Few issues in higher education are as fundamental as the ability to search for, evaluate, and synthesize information. The need to develop information literacy, the process of finding, retrieving, organizing, and evaluating the ever-expanding collection of online information, has precipitated the need for training in skill-based competencies in higher education, as well as medical and dental education. METHODS The current study evaluated the information literacy skills of first-year dental students, consisting of two, consecutive dental student cohorts (n = 160). An assignment designed to evaluate information literacy skills was conducted. In addition, a survey of student online search engine or database preferences was conducted to identify any significant associations. Subsequently, an intervention was developed, based upon the results of the assessment and survey, to address any deficiencies in information literacy. RESULTS Nearly half of students (n = 70/160 or 43%) missed one or more question components that required finding an evidence-based citation. Analysis of the survey revealed a significantly higher percentage of students who provided incorrect responses (n = 53/70 or 75.7%) reported using Google as their preferred online search method (p < 0.01). In contrast, a significantly higher percentage of students who reported using PubMed (n = 39/45 or 86.7%) were able to provide correct responses (p < 0.01). Following a one-hour intervention by a health science librarian, virtually all students were able to find and retrieve evidence-based materials for subsequent coursework. CONCLUSIONS This study confirmed that information literacy among this student population was lacking and that integration of modules within the curriculum can help students to filter and establish the quality of online information, a critical component in the training of new health care professionals. Furthermore, incorporation of these modules early in the curriculum may be of significant value to other dental, medical, health care, and professional schools with similar goals of incorporating the evidence base into teaching and learning activities.},

This requires librarians to develop partnerships with workplace communities so as to understand the role that information plays in the knowledge economy; and to develop a new language that is relevant to workplace communities and ties information literacy instruction to the authentic situations of the workplace. Information literacy is a meta-competency: it is the currency of the knowledge economy. The themes introduced in this paper are drawn from the current doctoral research of the author.

The authors draw on their experience designing the BiblioBouts information literacy game, deploying it in dozens of college classrooms across the country, and evaluating its effectiveness for teaching students how to conduct library research. The multi-modal evaluation of BiblioBouts involved qualitative and quantitative data collection methods and analyses. Drawing on the evaluation, the authors describe how students played this particular information literacy game and make recommendations for the design of future information literacy games. You’ll learn how the game’s design evolved in response to student input and how students played the game including their attitudes about playing games to develop information literacy skills and concepts specifically and playing educational games generally. The authors describe how students benefited as a result of playing the game. Drawing from their own first-hand experience, research, and networking, the authors feature best practices that educators and game designers in LIS specifically and other educational fields generally need to know so that they build classroom games that students want to play. Best practices topics covered include pre-game instruction, rewards, feedback, the ability to review/change actions, ideal timing, and more. The final section of the book covers important concepts for future information literacy game design.},

  title    = {Learning Through Self-Direction},
  abstract = {There is a growing emphasis in tertiary education that students should develop professional and work related skills within the course of their education. In order to learn these skills effectively, students must be able to learn in a self-regulated way, which means having the capacity to plan, set goals and analyse tasks to achieve particular outcomes. Often referred to as self-directed or metacognitive skills, these abilities characterise learners who are equipped with a range of personal transferable skills. Designing learning activities that support self-direction must become one of the core concerns of tertiary educators if enduring learning outcomes are to be achieved. This paper takes as its focus a professional learning context where students learn project management and work related skills in the final year of their studies. In this study, students were required to submit solutions to an on-line discussion space, where other teams provided peer assessment and constructive feedback. Analysis of verbal transactions informed by socio-cultural theory showed that successful learning took place, the evidence for which was the quality of group processes, problem solving and verbal interaction, together with personal reflections on task and self-reports of skills developed. Several important issues emerge from this research that have implications for the design of online courses for professional learning at tertiary level. These include task design that enables team-based problem solving, feedback processes, autonomy in student learning and support for reflection.},

Institutions are engaging students in digital literacy projects through a range of roles such as co-researchers, mentors, and technical support. The advantages are that students are generally more digitally confident and fluent than staff in the use of personal and social media. Although students need support in applying this digital know-how successfully to academic study, they are often more willing to explore the possibilities that technology can bring to their learning.

# Seven process components of ICT literacy

The framework identifies seven process components of ICT literacy that represent the knowledge and skills needed for a problem-oriented use of modern ICT (ETS, 2002; Katz, 2007). The seven process components are defi ned as follows:
1) Define: basic knowledge of hardware components, operating systems, and relevant software applications (e.g., word processing, e-mail);
2) Access: knowledge of basic operations used to retrieve information (e.g., entering a search term in an internet browser, opening and saving a document);
3) Manage: the ability to fi nd information within a program (e.g., retrieving information from tables, processing the hits returned by a search engine);
4) Create: the ability to create and edit documents and files (e.g., setting up tables, creating formulas);
5) Integrate: the ability to retrieve information efficiently (e.g., entering appropriate search terms), to compare it in terms of specific criteria (e.g., sorting datasets), or to organize and structure information with the aid of software applications (e.g., presenting the information retrieved in a table);
6) Evaluate: the ability to assess information and to use it as the basis for informed decisions (e.g., assessing the credibility of the information retrieved);
7) Communicate: the ability to communicate information in appropriate and understandable form (e.g., writing e-mails, creating meaningful charts).

NEPS is the first study aiming to examine ICT literacy longitudinally across the lifespan using objective paper-pencil test instruments. To do so, it is necessary to develop reliable and valid test instruments that are capable of assessing ICT literacy longitudinally. On the basis of an assessment framework, we developed in an initial step an item pool for assessing the ICT literacy of secondary school students and tested the item pool in three pilot studies (Grade 5, 7 and 9). The item and scale analyses provided satisfying results and the item pool proved to be suitable for assessing ICT literacy longitudinally. In addition, validity analyses showed a satisfactory content validity and a high test fairness with regard to gender and school type.

  abstract  = {Digital Literacy and Digital Inclusion: Information Policy and the Public Library examines the interrelationships between digital literacy, digital inclusion, and public policy, emphasizing the impacts of these policy decisions on the ability of individuals and communities to successfully participate in the information society. This book is the first detailed consideration of digital literacy and digital inclusion as policy problems and as core issues in information policy and libraries. The unique features of this book include drawing together the key themes and findings from the discourse on digital literacy and digital inclusion widely spread among many fields; analyzing digital literacy and digital inclusion as policy issues, both being driven and regulated by policy; building on a wealth of original research conducted by the authors using different quantitative and qualitative data collection approaches on four different continents when analyzing these issues, providing unique examples, case studies, and perspectives; using information behavior theory to provide important insights about these issues at individual, community, and political levels; providing recommendations to inform practice in libraries and help libraries to frame their advocacy for public policies that support literacy and inclusion; and providing policy recommendations to improve the creation and implementation of policy instruments that promote digital literacy and digital inclusion. The authors of this book have been involved in this research for many years, and their experience provides a broad view across the literature, inherent problems, and national perspectives. This breadth allows this book to offer comprehensive policy recommendations, solutions, and best practices for an area that is fragmented in discourse, practice, and policy.},

Given the computer literacy efforts at the elementary and secondary levels, a college-level curriculum should build upon those skills by focusing on information literacy. Information literacy is the ability to acquire, process, use and communicate the information which is needed in one's personal and work life, regardless of the technology involved. There are three components of this information literacy curriculum. The Information Environment provides the motivation for understanding about technology and its uses. The Components of an Information System considers the acquisition and proper use of computer-based tools. Information Management is concerned with ensuring that relevant information is available, accurate and in a useful format. The intended students for this course are the end users, the non-computer science majors.},

The research was conducted under the JISC User Behaviour Monitoring and Evaluation Framework. Work was conducted in two strands, by two project teams, JUSTEIS and JUBILEE. JUSTEIS profiled the use of EIS and assessed the availability of EIS. JUBILEE objectives focussed on understanding the barriers and enablers, with a view to developing success criteria. JUSTEIS used a multi-stage stratified sampling process, and collected data from 270 respondents from 17 departments in the baseline survey (2001/2002). JUBILEE conducted in-depth fieldwork in five institutions and snapshot fieldwork in 10 institutions, collecting data from 528 respondents. Information skills and experience develop across work, home and study. There is a growing use of EIS in curriculum, but practice varies between institutions and disciplines. Tutors express concern about student's ability to evaluate and use the information that they find. Assignments can promote EIS use. The main categories of EIS used by students are search engines and organisational web sites. Search engines are the preferred search tools and search strategies are basic. Information skills are acquired through a variety of routes, with peer instruction, surfing and personal experience, instruction from tutors, and LIS induction and training all making an important contribution. The solutions to improving students’ information skills may include use of the Virtual Training Suites, but librarians need to adopt different roles in promoting and evaluating use of such tools.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Due to the development of technologies, communications, databases and information resource varieties in today's information age, our various social, economic, cultural and political needs cannot be fulfilled by relying merely on past knowledge and skills as done previously. Information literacy (IL) as a set of necessary skills for all of us is an effective way of treating new technologies and their effective application in our lives. The study aimed to survey the library users' views in the Central Library of Babol University of Medical Sciences (The Library), Iran, on the role and influences of librarians on their IL development and improvement. METHODS This analytical survey used a researcher-made questionnaire for data collection. Research population consisted of all users referring Information Unit of The Library during 22 September - 20 December 2010. Of them, 150 users participating in at least 5 workshops held by The Library were selected as the study sample. RESULTS Based on the findings, 52.7 percent of the subjects rated the influence of the librarians on their IL development much and very much. 44.7 percent claimed that they more acquired IL skills from librarians rather than others. 100 (63.3%) subjects preferred workshops held by the librarian to other workshops. CONCLUSION The users of Information Unit of The Library perceived the training IL skills by librarians as a main influencing factor in their IL development and achievement. This emphasized the necessity of teaching IL to users and training the librarians in better teaching IL skills to library user.},

  title    = {Long Term Evaluation of Information Literacy Programme},
  abstract = {The Technische Universität München library was the first university library in Germany to be certified by TÜV with respect to its ISO 9001:2001 quality management. One of the main objectives of our quality management policy is to measure customer satisfaction not only in the short-term, but also over longer periods of time, in order to constantly develop and improve our services. To this end, TUM library management have decided to conduct a long term evaluation of its information literacy (IL) programme. We regularly ask course participants for feedback immediately after the events and evaluate these yearly. Additionally, we have started to survey long term changes in awareness and sustainability of course content. The library’s IL programme has been in place for over three years, and has thus generated sufficient data for reliable evaluation. The main object of our investigation is the assessment of effectiveness of our IL programme and further guidance as to how we can improve our services. We have been evaluating about 100 IL events, which took place between 6 and 24 months ago. Our study includes the four main types of workshops, which comprise basic and advanced literature search, referencing, and reference management. An online survey contains questions regarding the significance and the application of the skills taught during the courses. We also ask about any identified lack of resources or learning goals, and our e-learning material. The first phase of the evaluation was conducted between February and March 2014. This paper presents our findings from the evaluation project, our conclusions, and recommendations for the further development of the IL programme.},

# Der Zusammenhang von Leidenschaft, Arbeit, Eingebung, "Gabe" und Hingabe an die Sache bei der wissenschaftlichen Arbeit

Nach Weber verlangt der "Beruf zur Wissenschaft" Leidenschaft und harte Arbeit als "Vorbedingung des Entscheidenden: der 'Eingebung'". Dazu gehören zwar auch persönliche Voraussetzungen wie eine (von Weber nicht näher beschriebene) "Gabe" (Begabung?); doch einen Kult der "Persönlichkeit" oder des "Erlebens" lehnt Weber strikt ab. Er fordert "Hingabe an die Sache", hinter die alles "Persönliche" zurücktreten muss.

Nach Weber führt die "zunehmende Intellektualisierung und Rationalisierung" nicht dazu, dass der einzelne Mensch mehr oder Genaueres über seine konkreten Lebensbedingungen weiß, sondern nur dazu, dass er glaubt, prinzipiell alles darüber erfahren zu können. "Das aber bedeutet: die Entzauberung der Welt".

Die Hoffnungen, Wissenschaft könne den Weg weisen zum "wahren Sein" (Antike), zur "wahren Kunst" und "wahren Natur" (Renaissance), zum "wahren Gott" (Protestantismus und frühe Naturwissenschaften) oder gar zum "wahren Glück", haben sich als Illusionen erwiesen.

"Vorausgesetzt ist bei jeder wissenschaftlichen Arbeit immer die Geltung der Regeln der Logik und Methodik [...]. Vorausgesetzt ist aber ferner: daß das, was bei wissenschaftlicher Arbeit herauskommt, wichtig im Sinn von 'wissenswert' sei. Und da stecken nun offenbar alle unsere Probleme darin. Denn diese Voraussetzung ist nicht wieder ihrerseits mit den Mitteln der Wissenschaft beweisbar. Sie läßt sich nur auf ihren letzten Sinn deuten, den man dann ablehnen oder annehmen muß, je nach der eigenen letzten Stellungnahme zum Leben."

# Wissenschaft ist nicht per se sinnvoll

Kein Naturwissenschaftler, Mediziner, Kunstwissenschaftler, Jurist, Historiker oder Kulturwissenschaftler kann mit den Mitteln seiner Wissenschaft beweisen, dass seine Arbeit sinnvoll ist. Alle setzen es als selbstverständlich voraus. Das ist es aber nach Weber "ganz und gar nicht".
