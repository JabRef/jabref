AB  - Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a group of disorders
      characterized by prolonged reversible cerebral vasoconstriction, associated with
      acute-onset, severe, episodic "thunderclap" headaches with or without other
      neurologic clinical features. We describe the first reported case, to our
      knowledge, of a patient with RCVS who was managed under general anesthesia in the
      field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. A 67-year-old woman with a diagnosis of
      RCVS made 2 months earlier was scheduled to undergo surgical extraction of the
      mandibular right third molar. Standard monitoring included noninvasive blood
      pressure measurement, pulse oximetry, and electrocardiography; a bispectral index
      (BIS) monitor sensor was placed on her forehead. General anesthesia was induced
      by target-controlled infusion of propofol to an effect site concentration of 5.0
      mug . mL-1, with remifentanil, 0.50 mug . kg-1 per minute, and rocuronium, 40 mg.
      After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained uneventfully with
      remifentanil, 0.15 to 0.2 mug . kg-1 per minute, and propofol, 2.0 to 3.0 mug .
      mL-1, in oxygen and air. The end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration was
      maintained at 38 to 42 mm Hg. The BIS reading was 40 to 60. Fentanyl, 0.1 mg, and
      acetaminophen, 750 mg, were administered before the end of surgery for
      postoperative analgesia. The postoperative course was uneventful, with no
      headaches or hypertensive complications. We successfully achieved anesthetic
      management with no appreciable clinical signs of cerebral ischemia or recurrence
      in a patient with RCVS. We used propofol as the anesthetic agent with BIS
      monitoring to detect cerebral ischemia. However, there is no definitive evidence
      of the utility of these measures for the prevention or diagnosis of RCVS, and
      further study is needed.
