AB Low-temperature studies of the absorption, photoluminescence,
   photodiffusion and photoconductivity spectra of Sn/sub 2/P/sub 2 /S/sub
   6/ crystals were carried out in the wide spectral range 0.8-3.5 eV. The
   position of defect energy levels relative to the crystal energy bands
   has been determined. It was shown that the photoionization transitions
   from the valence band to the level with the energy E/sub v /+1.35 eV
   are caused by the presence of the hole metastable state. In the optical
   and photoelectric spectra several bands were revealed with energy
   greater than the band gap of the crystal (E/sub g/ = 2.5 eV). It was
   established that these bands are caused by the optical transitions
   between the valence band and upper conduction bands. It was shown that
   the electron-hole recombination, caused by the band-to-band transitions
   with the participation of the upper conduction subbands, is fast and
   corresponds to the nanosecond region. The combined scheme of the defect
   energy level and the band-to-band electronic phototransitions in Sn/sub
   2/P/sub 2/S/sub 6/ crystals was constructed. A mechanism for the
   photorefractive effect in these crystals is proposed.
