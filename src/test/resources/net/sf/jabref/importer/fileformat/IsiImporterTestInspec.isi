AB We report on the generation of continuous-wave (cw) ultraviolet (UV)
   laser light at lambda =278 nm by optical frequency doubling of visible
   light in beta -BaB/sub 2/O/sub 4/ waveguides. Ridge-type waveguides
   were produced by He/sup +/ implantation, photolithography masking, and
   plasma etching. The final waveguides have core dimension of a few mu
   m/sup 2/ and show transmission losses of 5 dB/cm at 532 nm and less
   than 10 dB/cm at 266 nm. In our first experiments, a second harmonic
   power of 24 mu W has been generated at 278 nm in an 8 mm long waveguide
   pumped by 153 mW at 556 nm.

AB Low-temperature studies of the absorption, photoluminescence,
   photodiffusion and photoconductivity spectra of Sn/sub 2/P/sub 2 /S/sub
   6/ crystals were carried out in the wide spectral range 0.8-3.5 eV. The
   position of defect energy levels relative to the crystal energy bands
   has been determined. It was shown that the photoionization transitions
   from the valence band to the level with the energy E/sub v /+1.35 eV
   are caused by the presence of the hole metastable state. In the optical
   and photoelectric spectra several bands were revealed with energy
   greater than the band gap of the crystal (E/sub g/ = 2.5 eV). It was
   established that these bands are caused by the optical transitions
   between the valence band and upper conduction bands. It was shown that
   the electron-hole recombination, caused by the band-to-band transitions
   with the participation of the upper conduction subbands, is fast and
   corresponds to the nanosecond region. The combined scheme of the defect
   energy level and the band-to-band electronic phototransitions in Sn/sub
   2/P/sub 2/S/sub 6/ crystals was constructed. A mechanism for the
   photorefractive effect in these crystals is proposed.
