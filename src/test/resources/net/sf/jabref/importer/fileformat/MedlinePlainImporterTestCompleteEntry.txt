      interested in industrial health in early twentieth-century Britain has led us to 
      conclude that, in addition to apprehension about the potentially harmful impact
      of industrial work on the reproductive health of women, there was a great deal of
      interest in the health of young, unmarried girls in the workplace, particularly
      the factory. Adopting a broader time frame, we suggest that the First World War, 
      with its emphasis on the reproductive health of women, was an anomalous
      experience in a broader trend which stressed the growing acceptability of women's
      work within industry. Concern with girls' health and welfare embraced hygiene,
      diet, exercise, recreation, fashion and beauty within and outside of the 
      workplace, as well as the impact of the boredom and monotony associated with
      industrial work. The health problems of young women workers tended to be
      associated with behaviour and environment rather than biology, as were anxieties 
      about the impact of work on morals, habits and character. Efforts to ensure that 
      young female factory workers would be equipped to take their place as citizens
      and parents, we argue, often dovetailed rather than diverged with the 'boy
      labour' question.
