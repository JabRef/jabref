 integrated prototype fabricated in 0.35 mu m CMOS occupies 3.5 mm

 with input-referred noise of 7 mu V-rms over 5 kHz bandwidth. A switched-capacitor
 delta read-out data compression circuit trades recording accuracy
 for the output data rate. An array of 1.5 mm platinum-coated microelectrodes
 is bonded directly onto the die. Results of in vitro experimental
 recordings from intact mouse hippocampus validate the circuit design

 dry etching to achieve substantially vertical sidewalls with wet
 etching to achieve high etch rates and to protect the underlying
 substrate from attack. Dry etching alone would have taken 5 h, and
 wet etching alone would produce severe undercutting. In addition,
 using either technique alone produces undesirable surface morphologies.
 The mask used during etching is critical to a successful patterning
 outcome. E-beam evaporated Al was found to work well, adhering strongly
 to oxygen-plasma-treated PDMS and holding up well during both dry
 and wet etching. To prevent wrinkling of the PDMS, a fast deposition
 rate should be used.},

  Abstract                 = {A rapid, reversible enhancement of synaptic transmission from a sensory
 neuron is reported and explained by impulses that reverse direction,
 or reflect, at axon branch points. In leech mechanosensory neurons,
 where one can detect reflection because it is possible simultaneously
 to study electrical activity in separate branches, action potentials
 reflected from branch points within the central nervous system under
 physiological conditions. Synapses adjacent to these branch points
 were activated twice in rapid succession, first by an impulse arriving
 from the periphery and then by its reflection. This fast double-firing
 facilitated synaptic transmission, increasing it to more than twice
 its normal level. Reflection occurred within a range of resting membrane
 potentials, and electrical activity produced by mechanical stimulation
 changed membrane potential so as to produce and cease reflection.
 A compartmental model was used to investigate how branch-point morphology
 and electrical activity contribute to produce reflection. The model
 shows that mechanisms that hyperpolarize the membrane so as to impair
 action potential propagation can increase the range of structures
 that can produce reflection. This suggests that reflection is more
 likely to occur in other structures where impulses fail, such as
 in axons and dendrites in the mammalian brain. In leech sensory neurons,
 reflection increased transmission from central synapses only in those
 axon branches that innervate the edges of the receptive field in
 the skin, thereby sharpening spatial contrast. Reflection thus allows
 a neuron to amplify synaptic transmission from a selected group of
 its branches in a way that can be regulated by electrical activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Two fundamental questions about neuron cell culture were addressed.
 Can one serum-free medium that was developed for optimum growth of
 hippocampal neurons support the growth of neurons from other regions
 of the brain? Is the region specific state of differentiation maintained
 in culture? To answer these questions, we isolated neurons from six
 other rat brain regions, placed them in culture in B27/Neurobasal
 defined medium, and analyzed their morphology and growth dependence
 on cell density after 4 days in culture. Neuronal identity was confirmed
 by immunostaining with antibodies to neurofilament 200. Neurons from
 each brain region maintained distinctive morphologies in culture
 in the virtual absence of glia. Cells isolated from embryonic day
 18 cerebral cortex by digestion with papain showed the same high
 survival as hippocampal neurons, e.g., 70\% survival for cells plated
 at 160/mm2. At this age and density, neurons from the septum showed
 slightly lower survival, 45\%. Survival of dentate granule neurons
 from postnatal day four brains was 30-40\%, significantly lower,
 and relatively independent of plating density. This suggests an absence
 of dependence on trophic factors or contact for dentate granule neurons.
 Growth of cerebellar granule neurons isolated from postnatal day
 7, 8, or 9 brains in B27/Neurobasal was compared to growth in BME/10\%
 serum. Viability in serum-free medium at 4 days was much better than
 that in serum, did not require KCl elevated to 25 mM, and occurred
 without substantial growth of glia. Cerebellar granule neurons plated
 at 1,280 cells/mm2 were maintained in culture for three weeks with
 17\% of the original cell density surviving. Survival of cells isolated
 from embryonic day 18 substantia nigra was 50\% at 160 cells/mm2
 after 4 days, similar to that of striatum, but slightly less than
 hippocampal neuron survival. The dopaminergic phenotype of the substantia
 nigral neurons was maintained over 2 weeks in culture as judged by
 immunoreactivity with antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase. During
 this time, immunoreactivity was found in the processes as they grew
 out from the soma. Together, these studies suggest that B27/Neurobasal
 will be a useful medium for maintaining the differentiated growth
 of neurons from many brain regions. Potential applications of a common
 growth medium for different neurons are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Inability to culture adult central neurons and the failure of injured
 neurons to regenerate in the brain could be due to genetic controls
 or environmental inhibitors. We tested the environmental inhibitor
 hypothesis by attempting to regenerate adult rat neurons in B27/Neurobasal
 culture medium, a medium optimized for survival of embryonic neurons.
 To isolate neurons from their numerous connections, papain was the
 best of six different proteases screened on slices of hippocampus
 for survival of isolated cells after 4 days of culture. Use of a
 density gradient enabled separation of oligodendroglia and some enrichment
 of neurons and microglia from considerable debris which was inhibitory
 to sprouting and viability. With these techniques, about 900000 viable
 neurons were isolated from each hippocampus of any age rat from birth
 to 24-36 months, near the median mortality. FGF2 was found to enhance
 viability at least 3-fold to 40-80\%, independent of age, without
 affecting the length of the processes. Neurons were cultured for
 more than 3 weeks. These methods demonstrate that hippocampal neurons
 can regenerate axons and dendrites if provided with adequate nutrition
 and if inhibitors are removed. They also will enable aging studies.
 Therefore, the concept of environmental growth restriction may be
 more appropriate for neurons in the brain than the concept of a genetic
 block that precludes regeneration of processes.},

  Abstract                 = {The most interesting property of neurons is their long-distance propagation
 of signals as spiking action potentials. Since 1993, Neurobasal/B27
 has been used as a serum-free medium optimized for hippocampal neuron
 survival. Neurons on microelectrode arrays (MEA) were used as an
 assay system to increase spontaneous spike rates in media of different
 compositions. We find spike rates of 0.5 s(-1) (Hz) for rat embryonic
 hippocampal neurons cultured in Neurobasal/B27, lower than cultures
 in serum-based media and offering an opportunity for improvement.
 NbActiv4 was formulated by addition of creatine, cholesterol and
 estrogen to Neurobasal/B27 that synergistically produced an eightfold
 increase in spontaneous spike activity. The increased activity with
 NbActiv4 correlated with a twofold increase in immunoreactive synaptophysin
 bright puncta and GluR1 total puncta. Characteristic of synaptic
 scaling, immunoreactive GABAAbeta puncta also increased 1.5-fold
 and NMDA-R1 puncta increased 1.8-fold. Neuron survival in NbActiv4
 equaled that in Neurobasal/B27, but with slightly higher astroglia.
 Resting respiratory demand was decreased and demand capacity was
 increased in NbActiv4, indicating less stress and higher efficiency.
 These results show that NbActiv4 is an improvement to Neurobasal/B27
 for cultured networks with an increased density of synapses and transmitter
 receptors which produces higher spontaneous spike rates in neuron
 networks.},
