The propagation of an interface can be driven mechanically. % e.g. by a difference in the respective homeostatic stress of the different cell types. Computer simulations of growing tissues are employed to study the stability of the interface between two tissues on a substrate. From a mechanical perspective, the dynamics and stability of this system is controlled mainly by four parameters of the respective tissues: (i) the homeostatic stress (ii) cell motility (iii) tissue viscosity and (iv) substrate friction. For propagation driven by a difference in homeostatic stress, the interface is stable for tissue-specific substrate friction even for very large differences of homeostatic stress; however, it becomes unstable above a critical stress difference when the tissue with the larger homeostatic stress has a higher viscosity. A small difference in directed bulk motility between the two tissues suffices to result in propagation with a stable interface, even for otherwise identical tissues. Larger differences in motility force, however, result in a finite-wavelength instability of the interface. Interestingly, the instability is apparently bound by nonlinear effects and the amplitude of the interface undulations only grows to a finite value in time.")

The Nash-Moser theorem provides the fundamental tool to generalize the result of Palais to this infinite-dimensional setting. The presented slice theorem is illustrated by its application to gauge theories: the action of the gauge transformation group admits smooth slices at every point and thus the gauge orbit space is stratified by Fr\\'echet manifolds. Furthermore, a covariant and symplectic formulation of classical field theory is proposed and extensively discussed. At the root of this novel framework is the incorporation of field degrees of freedom F and spacetime M into the product manifold F * M. The induced bigrading of differential forms is used in order to carry over the usual symplectic theory to this new setting. The examples of the Klein-Gordon field and general Yang-Mills theory illustrate that the presented approach conveniently handles the occurring symmetries.")

It is not a new field in data processing actually, but in the recent years many researchers have been paying more attention on this area. Problems: The number of publication regarding DDM in high reputation journals and conferences has increased significantly. It makes difficult for researchers to gain a comprehensive view of DDM that require further research. Solution: We conducted a systematic literature review to map the previous research in DDM field. Our objective is to provide the motivation for new research by identifying the gap in DDM field as well as the hot area itself. Result: Our analysis came up with some conclusions by answering 7 research questions proposed in this literature review. In addition, the taxonomy of DDM research area is presented in this paper. Finally, this systematic literature review provides the statistic of development of DDM since 2000 to 2015, in which this will help the future researchers to have a comprehensive overview of current situation of DDM.")

The propagation of an interface can be driven mechanically. % e.g. by a difference in the respective homeostatic stress of the different cell types. Computer simulations of growing tissues are employed to study the stability of the interface between two tissues on a substrate. From a mechanical perspective, the dynamics and stability of this system is controlled mainly by four parameters of the respective tissues: (i) the homeostatic stress (ii) cell motility (iii) tissue viscosity and (iv) substrate friction. For propagation driven by a difference in homeostatic stress, the interface is stable for tissue-specific substrate friction even for very large differences of homeostatic stress; however, it becomes unstable above a critical stress difference when the tissue with the larger homeostatic stress has a higher viscosity. A small difference in directed bulk motility between the two tissues suffices to result in propagation with a stable interface, even for otherwise identical tissues. Larger differences in motility force, however, result in a finite-wavelength instability of the interface. Interestingly, the instability is apparently bound by nonlinear effects and the amplitude of the interface undulations only grows to a finite value in time.")

This law says that the average cell volume scales exponentially with growth rate, with a scaling exponent equal to the time from initiation of a round of DNA replication to the cell division at which the corresponding sister chromosomes segregate. Here, we sought to test the robustness of the growth law to systematic perturbations in cell dimensions achieved by varying the expression levels of mreB and ftsZ. We found that decreasing the mreB level resulted in increased cell width, with little change in cell length, whereas decreasing the ftsZ level resulted in increased cell length.

Moreover, the growth law remained valid over a range of growth conditions and dimension perturbations. The growth law can be quantitatively interpreted as a consequence of a tight coupling of cell division to replication initiation. Thus, its robustness to perturbations in cell dimensions strongly supports models in which the timing of replication initiation governs that of cell division, and cell volume is the key phenomenological variable governing the timing of replication initiation. These conclusions are discussed in the context of our recently proposed adder-per-origin model, in which cells add a constant volume per origin between initiations and divide a constant time after initiation.")
