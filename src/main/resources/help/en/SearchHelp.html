    <h1>Searching</h1>

    <h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>

    <p><em>CTRL-F</em> focuses the search interface.</p>

    <h2>Search modes</h2>
   
    <p>There are two search modes in JabRef.</p>
    
    <h3>Normal search</h3>

    <p>In a normal search, the program searches your
    database for all occurrences of the words in your search string,
    once you entered it. Only entries containing all words will be
    considered matches. To search for sequences of words, enclose
    the sequences in double quotes. For instance, the query
    <b>progress "marine aquaculture"</b> will match entries
    containing both the word "progress" and the phrase "marine
    aquaculture". All entries that don't match are hidden, leaving
    for display the matching entries only (filter mode), or are
    grayed-out (float mode). To stop displaying the search results,
    just clear the search field again.</p>

    <h3><a name="advanced" id="advanced"></a>Advanced search</h3>

    <p>In order to search specific fields only
    and/or include logical operators in the search expression, a
    special syntax is available in which these can be specified.
    E.g. to search for entries whose author is "Miller", enter:</p>

    <p>author = miller</p>

    <p>Both the field specification and the search term support
    regular expressions. If the search term contains spaces,
    enclose it in quotes. Do <i>not</i> use spaces in the field
    specification! E.g. to search for entries about image
    processing, type:</p>

    <p>title|keywords = "image processing"</p>

    <p>You can use "and", "or", "not", and braces as intuitively
    expected:</p>

    <p>(author = miller or title|keywords = "image processing") and
    not author = brown</p>

    <p>The "=" sign is actually a shorthand for "contains".
    Searching for an exact match is possible using "matches" or
    "==". Using "!=" tests if the search term is <i>not</i>
    contained in the field (equivalent to "not ... contains ...").
    The selection of field types to search (required, optional,
    all) is always overruled by the field specification in the
    search expression. To search for entries of a certain type, a
    pseudo field called "entrytype" is available:</p>

    <p>entrytype = thesis</p>

    <p>This finds entries whose type (as displayed in the
    "Entrytype" column) contains the word "thesis" (which would be
    "phdthesis" and "mastersthesis"). Another pseudo field
    "bibtexkey" allows to search for citation keys, e.g.</p>

    <p>bibtexkey = miller2005</p>

    <h2>Search settings</h2>

    <p>Next to the search text field, there are check boxes to toggle case sensitivity and use of regular expressions in the search.</p>
