        <li>Modified HTML conversion so single newline is displayed in the preview (and HTML exports) as
          &lt;br&gt;, while multiple newlines are displayed as &lt;p&gt;.</li>

            means that the value "test \textit{case}" now matches the search string "test case".</li>
        <li>Changed default table font family to "SansSerif".</li>
        <li>Can now create lock file while writing a bib file. The lock file is checked before

        <li>Fixed bug in Scifinder import where an empty Inventor field could overwrite the
            author field.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug in autocompleter. Current suggested completion would be added to the field
            if the user closed the entry editor or mouse clicked on another field.</li>
        <li>Fixed problem with exporting to some MySql versions. Patch by François Dorin.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug in handling of LaTeX character sequences - now sequences with = as command

        <li>Fixed bug: gray out / hide setting in groups panel is overridden on startup
            by search mode selection. Added separate prefs key for the groups setting.

        <li>Conditional blocks (\begin{field}...\end{field}) in layout files can now be given a
          semicolon-separated list of fields as argument. All fields must then be set for output
          to be given.</li>
