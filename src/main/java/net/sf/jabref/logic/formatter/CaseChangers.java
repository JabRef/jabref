 * Class with static methods for changing the case of strings and arrays of strings.
 * <p>
 * This class must detect the words in the title and whether letters are protected for case changes via enclosing them with '{' and '}' brackets.
 * Hence, for each letter to be changed, it needs to be known wether it is protected or not.
 * This can be done by starting at the letter position and moving forward and backword to see if there is a '{' and '}, respectively.
