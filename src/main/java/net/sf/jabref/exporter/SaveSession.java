/**
 * Class used to handle safe storage to disk.
 * <p>
 * Usage: create a SaveSession giving the file to save to, the encoding, and whether to make a backup. The SaveSession
 * will provide a Writer to store to, which actually goes to a temporary file. The Writer keeps track of whether all
 * characters could be saved, and if not, which characters were not encodable.
 * <p>
 * After saving is finished, the client should close the Writer. If the save should be put into effect, call commit(),
 * otherwise call cancel(). When canceling, the temporary file is simply deleted and the target file remains unchanged.
 * When committing, the temporary file is copied to the target file after making a backup if requested and if the target
 * file already existed, and finally the temporary file is deleted.
 * <p>
 * If committing fails, the temporary file will not be deleted.
