<h1>EndNote Export Filter</h1>

<h2>Export from JabRef</h2>

JabRef can export databases to EndNote-readable files.
To use this feature, choose <b>File -> Export -> EndNote</b>, 
then specify the name of the export file.

<h2>Import to EndNote</h2>

The default EndNote Import filter does not handle multiple authors or
editors properly. There are two options to work around this:

<ol>

<li>Use the built-in filter and fix the file later. To open up
the file in EndNote, create a new database or open an old database in
EndNote. Then select <b>File -> Import</b>, click on <b>Choose
File</b>, then highlight the exported file and
click <b>Choose</b>. Click on <b>Import Options</b> and
select <b>EndNote Import</b>. Click <b>Import</b> to start the
import. After import, select <b>Edit-> Change Text</b>. Change <b>Any
Field</b> to <b>Author</b>. Enter " and " into the search field
(without quotes). enter a return character into the change field
(option-return on Mac OS X, ctrl-return on Windows
XP). Click <b>Change</b>. Repeat with the <b>Secondary Author</b>
field.

<li>Install the <i>EndNote Import from JabRef filter</i> in
the <i>EndNote Extras</i>. Follow the instructions in <i>Advanced
Use</i> below. To open up the file in EndNote, create a new database
or open an old database in EndNote. Then select <b>File -> Import</b>,
click on <b>Choose File</b>, then highlight the exported file and
click <b>Choose</b>. Click on <b>Import Options</b> and
select <b>EndNote Import from JabRef</b> (if it does not appear,
select Other filters. If it still doesn't appear, it was not correctly
installed.) Click <b>Import</b> to start the import.

</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>

The EndNote Export filter maps BibTeX entrytypes to EndNote reference
types as follows:

<pre>
BibTeX entrytype -> Endnote Reference Type
------------------------------------------
misc, other -> Generic
unpublished -> Manuscript
manual -> Computer Program
article -> Journal Article
book -> Book
booklet -> Personal Communication
inbook,incollection -> Book Section
inproceedings -> Conference Proceedings
techreport -> Report
mastersthesis, phdthesis -> Thesis
</pre>

<h2>Corporate Authors</h2>

By default, the export filter assumes that entries in the author or
editor fields in brackets are corporate authors and replaces the
brackets with a trailing comma. However, this means that entries that
include LaTeX code in brackets will be assumed to be corporate authors
and therefore will be improperly formatted.

<H2>Advanced Use: Endnote Extras</h2>

<h3>Installing the EndNote Import from JabRef filter</h3>

The default EndNote Import filter does not properly parse authors. The
EndNote Import from JabRef filter does.  Additionally, this filter
will recognize a field endnotereftype that will override the default
mapping. To install the filter, extract the EndNote Extras (<b>File -> 
Export - > Unpack EndNote filter set</b>) and unpack the Zip file which is created.
Then follow the directions in the file Readme.txt.<p>

<h3>Modifying EndNote Reference Types</h3>

Several fields used by BibTeX are not part of EndNote's default
Reference Types. While import from JabRef and export to JabRef will
work fine without modifying reference types, the field names will not
display correctly in EndNote (e.g. an entry window will call the pdf
field <i>Custom 1</i> instead of <i>pdf</i>. Additionally, these
fields cannot be added to new entries in EndNote, since they will not
appear in the entry window. To modify the EndNote Reference Types,
extract the EndNote Extras and follow the directions in the file
readme.txt.<p>

<h3>Export to JabRef</h3> 

EndNote comes with an export style BibTeX. However, this does not
support all BibTeX types and fields, and does not support the
additional General Fields supported by JabRef (<i>pdf, owner, key,</i> etc.)
If you wish to have these fields supported, extract the EndNote
Extras and follow the directions in the file readme.txt.<p>
