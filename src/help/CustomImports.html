    <h1>Custom import filters</h1>

    <p>JabRef allows you to define and use your own importers, in
    very much the same way as the standard import filters are
    defined. An import filter is defined by one or more Java
    <i>classes</i>, which parse the contents of a file from an
    input stream and create BibTex-Entries. So with some basic Java
    programming you can add an importer for your favorite source of
    references or register a new, improved version of an existing
    importer. Also, this allows you to add compiled custom
    importers that you might have obtained e.g. from SourceForge
    without rebuilding JabRef (see "Sharing your work").</p>

    <p>Custom importers take precedence over standard importers.
    This way, you can override existing importers for the
    Autodetect and Command Line features of JabRef. Custom
    importers are ordered by name.</p>

    <h2>Adding a custom import filter</h2>

    <p>Make sure, you have a compiled custom import filter (one or
    more <code>.class</code> files as described below) and the
    class files are in a directory structure according to their
    package structure. To add a new custom import filter, open the
    dialog box <b>Options -&gt; Manage custom imports</b>, and
    click <b>Add from folder</b>. A file chooser will appear,
    allowing you to select the classpath of your importer, i.e. the
    directory where the top folder of the package structure of your
    importer resides. In a second file chooser you select your
    importer class file, which must be derived from
    <code>ImportFormat</code>. By clicking <b>Select new
    ImportFormat Subclass</b>, your new importer will appear in the
    list of custom import filters. All custom importers will appear
    in the <b>File -&gt; Import -&gt; Custom Importers</b> and
    <b>File -&gt; Import and Append -&gt; Custom Importers</b>
    submenus of the JabRef window.</p>

    <p>Please note that if you move the class to another directory
    you will have to remove and re-add the importer. If you add a
    custom importer under a name that already exists, the existing
    importer will be replaced. Although in some cases it is
    possible to update an existing custom importer without
    restarting JabRef (when the importer is not on the classpath),
    we recommend restarting JabRef after updating an
    custom-importer. You can also register importers contained in a
    ZIP- or JAR-file, simply select the Zip- or Jar-archive, then
    the entry (class-file) that represents the new importer.</p>

    <h2>Creating an import filter</h2>

    <p>For examples and some helpful
    files on how to build your own importer, please check our
    download page.</p>

    <h3>A simple example</h3>

    <p>Let us assume that we want to import files of the following
    form:</p>
    <pre>
1936;John Maynard Keynes;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money
2003;Boldrin &amp; Levine;Case Against Intellectual Monopoly
2004;ROBERT HUNT AND JAMES BESSEN;The Software Patent Experiment
</pre><br />
    <br />

    <p>In your favorite IDE or text editor create a class derived
    from <code>ImportFormat</code> that implements methods
    <code>getFormatName()</code>, <code>isRecognizedFormat</code>
    and <code>importEntries()</code>. Here is an example:</p>
    <pre>
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import net.sf.jabref.*;
import net.sf.jabref.imports.ImportFormat;
import net.sf.jabref.imports.ImportFormatReader;

public class SimpleCsvImporter extends ImportFormat {

  public String getFormatName() {
    return "Simple CSV Importer";
  }

  public boolean isRecognizedFormat(InputStream stream) throws IOException {
    return true; // this is discouraged except for demonstration purposes
  }

  public List importEntries(InputStream stream) throws IOException {
        ArrayList bibitems = new ArrayList();
    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(ImportFormatReader.getReaderDefaultEncoding(stream));

    String line = in.readLine();
    while (line != null) {
      if (!"".equals(line.trim())) {
        String[] fields = line.split(";");
        BibtexEntry be = new BibtexEntry(Util.createNeutralId());
        be.setType(BibtexEntryType.getType("techreport"));
        be.setField("year", fields[0]);
        be.setField("author", fields[1]);
        be.setField("title", fields[2]);
        bibitems.add(be);
        line = in.readLine();
      }
    }
        return bibitems;
  }
}
</pre><br />
    <br />

    <p>Note that the example is in the default package. Suppose you
    have saved it under
    <code>/mypath/SimpleCsvImporter.java</code>. Also suppose the
    JabRef-2.0.jar is in the same folder as
    <code>SimpleCsvImporter.java</code> and Java is on your command
    path. Compile it using a JSDK 1.4 e.g. with</p>
    <pre>
javac -classpath JabRef-2.0.jar SimpleCsvImporter.java
</pre>Now there should be a file
<code>/mypath/SimpleCsvImporter.class</code>.<br />
    <br />


    <p>In JabRef, open <b>Options -&gt; Manage custom imports</b>,
    and click <b>Add from folder</b>. Navigate to
    <code>/mypath</code> and click the <b>Select ...</b> button.
    Select the <code>SimpleCsvImporter.class</code> and click the
    <b>Select ...</b> button. Your importer should now appear in
    the list of custom importers under the name "Simple CSV
    Importer" and, after you click <b>Close</b> also in the <b>File
    -&gt; Import -&gt; Custom Importers</b> and <b>File -&gt;
    Import and Append -&gt; Custom Importers</b> submenus of the
    JabRef window.</p>

    <h2>Sharing your work</h2>

    <p>With custom importer files, it's fairly simple to share
    custom import formats between users. If you write an import
    filter for a format not supported by JabRef, or an improvement
    over an existing one, we encourage you to post your work on our
    SourceForge.net page. We'd be happy to distribute a collection
    of submitted import files, or to add to the selection of
    standard importers.</p>
