    <h1>PDF/PS/URL/DOI links in JabRef</h1>

    <p><b>Note:</b> JabRef 2.3
    and later versions offer an <a href="FileLinks.html">improved
    system for external file links</a>.</p>

    <p>JabRef lets you link up your entries with PDF or PS files
    stored on your system, as well as links to the document on the
    web in the form of an URL or a DOI identifier.</p>

    <h2>Setting up external viewers</h2>

    <p>The program has to know
    which external viewers to use for PDF, PS and web pages. These
    are by default set to values that probably make sense for your
    operating system, so there's a fair chance you don't have to
    change these values.</p>

    <p>To change the external viewer settings, go to <b>Options
    -&gt; Preferences -&gt; External programs</b>.</p>

    <h2>Opening external files or links</h2>

    <p>There are several ways
    to open an external file or web page. In the entry editor, you
    can double click on the text field containing the file name,
    DOI or URL. In the entry table you can select an entry and use
    the menu choice, keyboard shortcut or the right-click menu to
    open the file or web page. Finally, you can click on a PDF, PS,
    URL or DOI icon.</p>

    <p>By default the entry table will contain two columns with
    icons for those entries that link to external files and URLs.
    You can disable any of these in <b>Preferences -&gt; Table</b>.
    The second column of the entry table shows icons for PDF or PS
    files (only PDF if both are present), and the third column
    shows icons for URL or DOI (only URL if both are present). You
    open the file or web page by clicking on an icon.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> If the PS field does not appear in the entry
    editor (in the 'General' panel), you may have to
    <a href="GeneralFields.html">customize the entry types of the
    general fields</a>.</p>

    <h2>The main PDF and PS directories</h2>

    <p>JabRef makes it easy to
    link PDF and PS files to your entries. To take advantage of
    this, you have to indicate in <b>Options -&gt; Preferences
    -&gt; External programs</b> your main PDF and PS directories.
    All PDF and PS files that are stored in or below each of these
    directories will be referred to with a relative path by JabRef,
    making it easy for you if you need to move the PDF and PS
    directories, or if several users use the same database from
    different network places.</p>

    <p>Additionally, if you give your PDF and PS files names that
    correspond to the relevant entry's bibtex key (plus '.pdf' or
    '.ps'), JabRef will be able to search your main directories and
    its subfolders for the correct PDF and PS. Once the
    correctly-named PDF or PS is in place you access this function
    by clicking the 'Auto' button next to the PDF and PS fields in
    the entry editor. If the PDF or PS is found, the field will
    immediately be set.</p>

    <p>If you name a PDF or PS file as mentioned, you can also open
    the file without setting the PDF or PS field of the entry at
    all. The downside is that the PDF or PS icon will not appear in
    the table unless you do (manually or with the 'Auto'
    button).</p>

    <h2>The database-specific PDF and PS directories</h2>

    <p>You can set PDF and PS directories specific to a database
    (<b>File -&gt; Database properties</b>). These directories will
    supersede the main directories.</p>

    <h2><a name="RegularExpressionSearch"
       id="RegularExpressionSearch">Using Regular Expression Search
       for Auto-Linking</a></h2>

    <p>In the previous sections JabRef's auto-linking feature was
    described: If you choose names for your files corresponding to
    the bibtex-key + plus the extension, JabRef will automatically
    be able to find it.</p>

    <p>Since JabRef 2.2 it is now possible to have greater
    flexibility in the naming scheme by using regular expression
    for the search. In most cases it should not be necessary though
    to adapt the given default.</p>

    <p>If you open the external preferences (Options -&gt;
    Preferences -&gt; External Programs) you will find an option
    called "Use Regular Expression Search". Checking this option
    will allow you to enter your own regular expression for search
    in the PDF directories.</p>

    <p>The following syntax is understood:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>*</code> - Search in all immediate all
        subdirectories excluding the current and any deeper
        subdirectories.</li>

        <li><code>**</code> - Search in all subdirectories
        recursively AND the current directory.</li>

        <li><code>.</code> and <code>..</code> - The current
        directory and the parent directory.</li>

        <li><code>[title]</code> - All expressions in square
        brackets are replace by the corresponding field in the
        current entry</li>

        <li><code>[extension]</code> - Is replaced by the
        file-extension of the field you are using.</li>

        <li>All other text is interpreted as a regular expression.
        But caution: You need to escape backslashes by putting two
        backslashes after each other to not confuse them with the
        path-separator.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The default for searches is
    <code>**/.*[bibtexkey].*\\.[extension]</code>. As you can see
    this will search in all subdirectories of the extension-based
    directory (for instance in the PDF directory) for any file that
    has the correct extension and contains the Bibtex-key
    somewhere.</p>
