    <h1>Customizing the BibTeX key generator</h1>

    <p>In the 'Key pattern' tab in Preferences, one can set the fields
    used in auto generation of BibTex labels. The pattern can be
    set for each of the standard entry types.</p>

    <h2>Key patterns</h2>

    <p>The pattern can contain any text you wish,
    in addition to field markers that indicate that a specific
    field of the entry should be inserted at that position of the
    key. A field marker generally consists of the field name
    enclosed in square braces, e.g. <b>[volume]</b>. If the field
    is undefined in an entry at the time of key generation, no text
    will be inserted by the field marker.</p>

    <p>Several special field markers are offered, which extract
    only a specific part of a field. These are listed below. Feel
    free to suggest new special field markers.</p>

    <p>Special field markers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>[<code>auth</code>]</b>: The last name of the first
        author<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>authors</code>]</b>: The last name of all
        authors<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>authorLast</code>]</b>: The last name of the last
        author<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>authorsN</code>]</b>: The last name of up to
        N authors. If there are more authors, "EtAl" is
        appended.<br /></li>
        
        <li><b>[<code>authorsAlpha</code>]</b>: Corresponds to the BibTeX
        style "alpha". One author: First three letters of the last name.
        Two to four authors: First letters of last names concatenated.
        More than four authors: First letters of last names of first three
        authors concatenated. "+" at the end. <br /></li>  

        <li><b>[<code>authIniN</code>]</b>: The beginning of each
        author's last name, using no more than N
        characters.<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>authorIni</code>]</b>: The first 5 characters
        of the first author's last name, and the last name initials
        of the remaining authors.<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>authN</code>]</b>: The first N characters of
        the first author's last name<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>authN_M</code>]</b>: The first N characters
        of the Mth author's last name<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>auth.auth.ea</code>]</b>: The last name of
        the first two authors, and ".ea" if there are more than
        two.<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>auth.etal</code>]</b>: The last name of the
        first author, and the last name of the second author if
        there are two authors or ".etal" if there are more than
        two.<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>authshort</code>]</b>: The last name if one
        author is given; the first character of up to three
        authors' last names if more than one author is given. A
        plus character is added, if there are more than three
        authors.<br /></li>
    </ul><b>Note:</b> If there is no author (as in the case of an
    edited book), then all of the above
    <b><code>[auth...]</code></b> markers will use the editor(s)
    (if any) as a fallback. Thus, the editor(s) of a book with no
    author will be treated as the author(s) for label-generation
    purposes. If you do not want this behaviour, i.e. you require a
    marker which expands to nothing if there is no author, use
    <b><code>pureauth</code></b> instead of
    <b><code>auth</code></b> in the above codes. For example,
    <b><code>[pureauth]</code></b>, or
    <b><code>[pureauthors3]</code></b>.

    <ul>
        <li><b>[<code>edtr</code>]</b>: The last name of the first
        editor<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>edtrIniN</code>]</b>: The beginning of each
        editor's last name, using no more than N
        characters<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>editors</code>]</b>: The last name of all
        editors<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>editorLast</code>]</b>: The last name of the last
        editor<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>editorIni</code>]</b>: The first 5 characters
        of the first editor's last name, and the last name initials
        of the remaining editors.<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>edtrN</code>]</b>: The first N characters of
        the first editor's last name<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>edtrN_M</code>]</b>: The first N characters
        of the Mth editor's last name<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>edtr.edtr.ea</code>]</b>: The last name of
        the first two editors, and ".ea" if there are more than
        two.<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>edtrshort</code>]</b>: The last name if one
        editor is given; the first character of up to three
        editors' last names if more than one editor is given. A
        plus character is added, if there are more than three
        editors.<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>firstpage</code>]</b>: The number of the
        first page of the publication (Caution: this will return 
        the lowest number found in the pages field, since bibtex 
        allows <code>7,41,73--97</code> or <code>43+</code>.)<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>keywordN</code>]</b>: Keyword number N from
        the "keywords" field, assuming keywords are separated by
        commas or semicolons.<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>lastpage</code>]</b>: The number of the last
        page of the publication (See the remark on 
        <code>firstpage</code>)<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>shorttitle</code>]</b>: The first 3 words of
        the title<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>shortyear</code>]</b>: The last 2 digits of
        the publication year<br /></li>

        <li><b>[<code>veryshorttitle</code>]</b>: The first word of
        the title, discounting 'the', 'a', 'an'.<br /></li>
    </ul>

    <p>A field name (or one of the above pseudo-field names) may
    optionally be followed by one or more modifiers. Modifiers are
    applied in the order they are specified.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>:abbr</b>: Abbreviates the text produced by the
        field name or spcial field marker. Only the first character
        and subsequent characters following white space will be
        included. For example, <b>[journal:abbr]</b> would from the
        journal name "Journal of Fish Biology" produce
        "JoFB".<br /></li>

        <li><b>:lower</b>: Forces the text inserted by the field
        marker to be in lowercase. For example, <b>[auth:lower]</b>
        expands the last name of the first author in
        lowercase.<br /></li>

        <li><b>:upper</b>: Forces the text inserted by the field
        marker to be in uppercase. For example, <b>[auth:upper]</b>
        expands the last name of the first author in
        uppercase.<br /></li>

        <li><b>:(x)</b>: Replace x by any string. The string between
        the parentheses will be inserted if the field marker preceding this
        modifier resolves to an empty value. For instance, the marker
        <b>[volume:(unknown)]</b> will return the entry's volume if set, and the
        string <b>unknown</b> if the entry's <code>volume</code> field is not set.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you haven't defined a key pattern for a certain entry
    type, the <b>Default key pattern</b> will be used. You can
    change the default pattern - its setting is above the list of
    entry types in the <b>Key pattern</b> section of the
    <b>Preferences</b> dialog.</p>

    <p>The default key pattern is [auth][year], and this could
    produce keys like e.g. <code>Yared1998</code> If the key is not
    unique in the current database, it is made unique by adding one
    of the letters a-z until a unique key is found. Thus, the
    labels might look like:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <code>Yared1998</code><br />
         <code>Yared1998a</code><br />
        <code>Yared1998b</code>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Regular expression replace</h2>

    <p>After the key pattern has
    been applied to produce a key, you can choose to have the key
    generator search for occurences of a specific regular
    expression, and replace it with a string. The regular
    expression and replacement string are entered in the text
    fields below the list of key patterns. If the replacement
    string is empty, matches of the regular expression will simply
    be removed from the generated key.</p>
