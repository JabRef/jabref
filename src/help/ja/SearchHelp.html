    <h1>Searching</h1>

    <h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>

    <p><em>CTRL-F</em> opens or focuses the search interface.
    Pressing <em>CTRL-F</em> several times toggles search mode.
    When searching incrementally, pressing <em>CTRL-F</em> makes
    the program search for the next occurence of the search
    string.</p>

    <p><em>CTRL-SHIFT-F</em> opens or focuses the search interface,
    and selects incremental search. When searching incrementally,
    <em>CTRL-SHIFT-F</em> also finds the next occurence of the
    search string.</p>

    <h2>Search modes</h2>
   
    <p>There are three search modes in JabRef.</p>
    
    <h3>Incremental search</h3>

    <p>When searching incrementally, the
    program searches immediately each time you press a letter. The
    status line informs you about the success of the search.
    Pressing the search shortcut keys causes the program to find
    the next occurrence of the current search string. If no further
    occurrences can be found, the status line will notify you about
    this. Repeating the search again causes the search to restart
    at the top. The search order always follows the current sorting
    of your database. To escape an incremental search, press ESC or
    click "Clear search".</p>

    <h3>Normal search</h3>

    <p>In a normal search, the program searches your
    database for all occurences of the words in your search string,
    once you press ENTER. Only entries containing all words will be
    considered matches. To search for sequences of words, enclose
    the sequences in double quotes. For instance, the query
    <b>progress "marine aquaculture"</b> will match entries
    containing both the word "progress" and the phrase "marine
    aquaculture". All entries that don't match are hidden, leaving
    for display the matching entries only (filter mode), or are
    grayed-out (float mode). To stop displaying the search results,
    press ESC or click "Clear search".</p>

    <h3><a name="advanced" id="advanced"></a>
        Advanced search</h3>

    <p>In order to search specific fields only
    and/or include logical operators in the search expression, a
    special syntax is available in which these can be specified.
    E.g. to search for entries whose author is "Miller", enter
    (in any but incremental search mode):</p>

    <p>author = miller</p>

    <p>Both the field specification and the search term support
    regular expressions. If the search term contains spaces,
    enclose it in quotes. Do <i>not</i> use spaces in the field
    specification! E.g. to search for entries about image
    processing, type:</p>

    <p>title|keywords = "image processing"</p>

    <p>You can use "and", "or", "not", and braces as intuitively
    expected:</p>

    <p>(author = miller or title|keywords = "image processing") and
    not author = brown</p>

    <p>The "=" sign is actually a shorthand for "contains".
    Searching for an exact match is possible using "matches" or
    "==". Using "!=" tests if the search term is <i>not</i>
    contained in the field (equivalent to "not ... contains ...").
    The selection of field types to search (required, optional,
    all) is always overruled by the field specification in the
    search expression. To search for entries of a certain type, a
    pseudo field called "entrytype" is available:</p>

    <p>entrytype = thesis</p>

    <p>This finds entries whose type (as displayed in the
    "Entrytype" column) contains the word "thesis" (which would be
    "phdthesis" and "mastersthesis"). Another pseudo field
    "bibtexkey" allows to search for citation keys, e.g.</p>

    <p>bibtexkey = miller2005</p>

    <h2>Search settings</h2>

    <p>The <em>Settings</em> button opens a
    menu that allows to toggle case sensitivity and use of regular
    expressions in the search, and whether search results should be
    selected in the table and whether the search words should be
    highlighted in the editor and the preview.</p>
