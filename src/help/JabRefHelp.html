<P><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>bibtex</em> program is mentioned many times in these help
files. <em>Bibtex</em> is a utility for the generation of
bibliographic references in LaTeX documents, created by Oren
Patashnik. The same database format is also used with CiteMaker,
a utility for bibliography generation in Adobe FrameMaker.

<P>JabRef is is a program for working with <em>bibtex</em>
databases. The program uses no internal file format, which means you
normally load and save your databases directly in the <em>bibtex</em>
.bib format. However, you can also import bibliography databases in a
number of other formats into JabRef.

<P>JabRef provides sorting and searching functionality for getting
the overview of your databases' contents. You can easily add new
database entries without having to remember what information is
required, and <em>bibtex</em> keys can be autogenerated.  JabRef
will be most useful for those using <em>bibtex</em> or CiteMaker, but
may also be of use to those using other referencing systems or simply
wanting to organize their literature sources.
