  abstract  = {The Crystallography Open Database (COD), which is a project that aims to gather all available inorganic, metal-organic and small organic molecule structural data in one database, is described. The database adopts an open-access model. The COD currently contains ~80 000 entries in crystallographic information file format, with nearly full coverage of the International Union of Crystallography publications, and is growing in size and quality.},
