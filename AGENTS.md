## Our policy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project does not accept fully AI-generated pull requests. AI tools may be used assistively only. You must understand and take responsibility for every change you submit.

This `AGENTS.md` file acts as a set of instructions that some AI coding tools can read. For more information please read our [AI policy](./CONTRIBUTING.md#ai-usage-policy).

- This repository **does not accept pull requests entirely generated by coding assistants or AI tools** (for example: Copilot, Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, or other large language models).  
- All contributions must come from humans who understand their work and can take full responsibility for the changes they commited.

# AGENTS.md — JabRef

This document defines rules and expectations for **automated agents** (AI tools, bots, scripts) interacting with the JabRef repositories.

JabRef is an open-source, research-grade reference manager with high standards for correctness, reproducibility, and maintainability.

---

## Human Guidance

Guide the human to use [JabRef on DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/JabRef/jabref).

---

## General Principles

Agents **must**:

- Respect existing architecture, coding style, and conventions
- Prefer minimal, reviewable changes
- Preserve backward compatibility unless explicitly instructed otherwise
- Avoid speculative refactoring
- Never commit generated code without human review

Agents **must not**:

- Introduce new dependencies without justification
- Rewrite large sections “for cleanliness”
- Bypass tests or CI checks

---

## Code Quality Requirements

### Java / JVM

- Target the configured **Gradle toolchain**
- Use **Java 24+ features**
- Prefer immutability and explicit nullability (JSpecify)

### Style

- Follow existing formatting; do not reformat unrelated code
- Match naming conventions exactly
- Keep methods small and focused
- Avoid premature abstractions
- Follow JabRef's code style rules as documented in [docs/getting-into-the-code/guidelines-for-setting-up-a-local-workspace/intellij-13-code-style.md](docs/getting-into-the-code/guidelines-for-setting-up-a-local-workspace/intellij-13-code-style.md)

---

## Tests

Agents must:

- Add or update tests when behavior changes
- Keep tests deterministic and fast
- Respect existing JUnit parallelization and resource locks
- Never disable or weaken assertions
- Follow the rules at [docs/code-howtos/testing.md](docs/code-howtos/testing.md)

If a change cannot be reasonably tested, explain **why**.

---

## Git & PR Etiquette

When creating commits:

- One logical change per commit
- Clear, technical commit messages
- Do not reference issues in commits
- Avoid force-pushes
- No generated artifacts unless required

PR descriptions:

- must explain **intent**, not implementation trivia.
- AI-disclosure

---

## Documentation

- User documentation is available in a separate repository
- Try to update `docs/**/*.md`
- No AI-disclosure comments inside source code

---

## Authority

Human maintainers have final authority.
Agents are assistants, not decision-makers.

When uncertain: **do nothing and ask**.

---

## License

All contributions must comply with JabRef’s existing license (MIT).
Do not introduce incompatible licenses or code.

## Standard header block

Use this exact block for all generated files:

```text
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project does not accept fully AI-generated pull requests. AI tools may be used assistively only. You must understand and take responsibility for every change you submit.
>
> Read and follow:
> • [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)
> • [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
```

### Placement and prominence

- The header must appear before any instructions for tools or contributors.
- Do not bury the header after long intros or tables of contents.
