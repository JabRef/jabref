## Miscellaneous Hints

### Command Line

The package `org.jabref.cli` is responsible for handling the command line options.

During development, one can configure IntelliJ to pass command line parameters:

![IntelliJ-run-configuration](.gitbook/assets/intellij-run-configuration-command-line%20%282%29.png)

Passing command line arguments using gradle is currently not possible as all arguments \(such as `-Dfile.encoding=windows-1252`\) are passed to the application.

Without jlink, it is not possible to generate a fat jar any more. During development, the capabilities of the IDE has to be used.

## FAQ

* Q: I get `java: package org.jabref.logic.journals does not exist`.  

  A: You have to ignore `buildSrc/src/main`  as source directory in IntelliJ as indicated in our [setup guide](https://devdocs.jabref.org/getting-into-the-code/guidelines-for-setting-up-a-local-workspace).

     Also filed as IntelliJ issue [IDEA-240250](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-240250).
