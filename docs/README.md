- External: [Sync your fork with the JabRef repository](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)
- External (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª): Branches and pull requests: <https://github.com/unibas-marcelluethi/software-engineering/blob/master/docs/week2/exercises/practical-exercises.md>

## Command Line

The package `org.jabref.cli` is responsible for handling the command line options.

During development, one can configure IntelliJ to pass command line paramters:

Passing command line arguments using gradle is currently not possible as all arguments (such as `-Dfile.encoding=windows-1252`) are passed to the application.

Without jlink, it is not possible to generate a fat jar any more. During development, the capabilities of the IDE has to be used.
