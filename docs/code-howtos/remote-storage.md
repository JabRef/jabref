# Remote Storage

JabRef supports kinds of remote storage:

- JabDrive
- SQL databases

The first one is the more modern approach allowing offline-work.
The second approach makes use of the SQL features of databases and require direct online connections.

More details in [JabDrive](remote-storage-jabdrive.md) and [SQL Storage](remote-storage-sql.md) respectively.
