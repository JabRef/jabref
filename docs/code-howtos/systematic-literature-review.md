# Systematic Literature Review (SLR) Tool
The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) tool in JabRef helps researchers conduct structured literature reviews. It allows defining research questions, creating search queries, selecting academic catalogs, and collecting references in a reproducible way.
This tool is especially useful for researchers who want to follow a structured and transparent review methodology.
---
## Starting a Systematic Literature Review
1. Open JabRef.
2. Navigate to **Tools → Start new systematic literature review**.
3. The **Define study parameters** window opens.
---
## Authors and Title
In the **Authors and Title** tab:
- Enter the **study title**.
- Add at least one **author**.
Both fields are required before starting the survey.
---
## Research Questions
In the **Research Questions** tab:
- Define one or more research questions.
- These questions guide the scope and purpose of the review.
Each question should be clear and specific to ensure a focused search process.
---
## Queries
In the **Queries** tab:
- Add search queries used to retrieve relevant publications.
- Queries typically combine keywords using Boolean operators.
---
## Catalogs
In the **Catalogs** tab:
- Select one or more academic catalogs to search in.
- Examples include:
  - ACM Portal
  - arXiv
  - DBLP
  - Crossref
  - IEEE Xplore
- Choosing multiple catalogs increases coverage of the literature.
These catalogs are used as data sources for retrieving publications.
---
## Finalize
In the **Finalize** tab:
- Select the directory where the study data will be stored.
- JabRef creates the study structure in this folder.
- Ensure all required fields are completed:
  - Study title
  - At least one author
  - At least one research question
  - At least one query
When everything is set, click **Start survey**.
---
## After Starting the Survey
Once the survey starts:
- JabRef runs the defined queries on the selected catalogs.
- Results are collected and stored in the study.
- References can then be:
  - Reviewed
  - Filtered
  - Tagged
  - Exported
This supports a structured and reproducible review workflow.
---
## Tips for Effective SLRs
- Use clear and specific research questions.
- Start with broader queries, then refine.
- Combine keywords using Boolean operators:
  - `AND`
  - `OR`
  - `NOT`
- Document all queries for reproducibility.

## Summary
The SLR tool in JabRef helps structure the entire review process:
1. Define study metadata  
2. Add research questions  
3. Create search queries  
4. Select catalogs  
5. Run the survey and collect results  
This makes literature reviews more systematic, transparent, and repeatable.
