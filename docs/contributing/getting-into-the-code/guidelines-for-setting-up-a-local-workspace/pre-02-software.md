# Pre Condition 2: Required Software

## git

It is strongly recommended that you have git installed.

* On Debian-based distros: `sudo apt-get install git`
* On Windows: [Download the installer](http://git-scm.com/download/win) and install it. Using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), you can run `choco install git.install -y --params "/GitAndUnixToolsOnPath /WindowsTerminal` to a) install git and b) have Linux commands such as `grep` available in your `PATH`.
* [Official installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Installed IDE

We highly encourdage [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/?from=jabref), because all other IDEs work less good.
Especially using VS.Code has issues.

IntelliJ's Community Edition works well.
Most contributors use the Ultimate Edition, because they are students getting that edition for free.

## Other Tooling

We collected some other tooling recommendations.
We invite you to read on at our [tool recommendations](../../code-howtos/tools.md).
