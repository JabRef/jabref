# Pre Condition 1: GitHub Account

If you do not yet have a GitHub account, please [create one](https://github.com/join).

Proposals for account names:

* Login similar to your university account. Example: `koppor`
* Use your last name prefixed by the first letter of your first name. Example: `okopp`
* Use `firstname.lastname`. Example: `oliver.kopp`

You can hide your email address by following the recommendations at [https://saraford.net/2017/02/19/how-to-hide-your-email-address-in-your-git-commits-but-still-get-contributions-to-show-up-on-your-github-profile-050/](https://saraford.net/2017/02/19/how-to-hide-your-email-address-in-your-git-commits-but-still-get-contributions-to-show-up-on-your-github-profile-050/).

Most developers, though, do not hide their email address. They use one which may get public. Mostly, they create a new email account for development only. That account then be used for development mailing lists, mail exchange with other developers, etc.

Examples:

* Same login as in GitHub (see above). Example: `koppor@gmail.com`
* "`it`" in the name. Example: `kopp.it@gmail.com`
* Use the university login. Example: `st342435@stud.uni-stuttgart.de`
