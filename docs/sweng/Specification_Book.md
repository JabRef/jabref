# Specification Book

## 1. Visions and Goals 

* /V10/ Reduce the time users spend to add entries to a library in Jabref.
* /V20/Â It is more efficient to use the parser, than adding the entries by hand.
* /G10/ Users can easily add entries to a library by parsing a plain text reference.
* /G20/ One or more entries can be parsed in one process.
* /G30/ Users can change the parsing results if necessary.

## 2. General Conditions / Stakeholders

* /S10/ Private users who work with latex
* /S20/ The Jabref developers
* /S30/ Us, the developers of the feature
* /S40/ The evaluators of our project (Tutors and Lecturers)
* /C10/ The project is based on the course Software Engineering at the University of Basel.
* /C10/ A group of 4 people is developing this feature.
* /C20/ The feature will be finished in 4 milestones.
* /C30/ Jabref is an existing software which allows the user to manage text references.
* /C40/ Jabref is an open source project that is developed freely.
* /C50/ Jabref is running on Linux / Windows and MacOS.
* /C60/ To accomplish the task an external parser should be used.

## 3. Context and Overview

* /O10/ Jabref is implemented with java.
* /O20/ There is already an existing parser from .bib files to Jabref entries.
* /O30/ There is an existing UI where the feature should be accessible.
* /O40/ The external parser must be added to the Jabref project as git submodule.

## 4. Functional Requirements

* /F10/ The feature must be accessible over the GUI.
* /F20/ The feature must start when the user presses on a context menu button.
* /F30/ The feature must give the user the possibility to add one or multiple .bib-entries to Jabref.
* /F40/ The feature must inform the user when an entry was successfully added.
* /F41/ This should be realized with a pop-up information window.
* /F50/ The feature must give the user the possibility to cancel the process while entering the plain text reference.
* /F60/ The feature must inform the user when a text could not be parsed.
* /F70/ The feature must give the user the possibility to change the parsed entry attributes.
* /F80/ The feature must give the user the possibility to overthrow the generated entry.
* /F90/ The feature must give the user the possibility to add another entry after successfully adding an entry.
* /F91/ This should be realized by a button on the success window described in /F41/.
* /F100/ The feature must use an external parser to extract the entry attributes.
* /F110/ The feature must convert the output of the external parser into a .bib-entry.
* /F120/ The feature must display the parsed .bib-entry with its attributes to the user.
* /F121/ This is also important for /F70/.
* /F130/ The feature should use Jabrefs internal duplication checker to ensure no duplicate is added to an library.
* /F140/ The feature must use Jabrefs internal .bib-entry parser in order to create a new BibEntry.
* /F141/ The BibEntry is updated when the user makes changes as specified in /F70/.
* /F150/ The feature must add the created BibEntry correctly to the currently opened library.
* /F160/ The feature should run only once at a time.
* /F161/ Therewith the windows the feature uses are displayed only once at a time.
* /F170/ Jabref should show an appropriate error message when the feature crashes.
* /F171/ Jabref should not save anything in the library when the feature unpredictably crashes.
* /F180/ The feature must be accessible again after it was closed.

## Attachment A. Use-cases

### Use Case 1:
* Name: *Adding bibtex entry with the feature*
* Agents: *Jabref user*
* Preconditions: *A plain reference text is available*
* Common process: 
    * Pressing "Add entry from plain text" button on the GUI (Jabref context menu)
    * Insert the plain reference text
    * Press the "parse" button on the GUI (pop-up window)
    * Check if the parser results are correct
