# References

**Synonyms:** Bibliographic References, Reference List, Literature, Literature List, Works Cited

## Meaning

**References** is a structured list of works cited in a scientific work.
collection of bibliographic records describing scholarly works such as articles, books, or reports.

In JabRef, a bibliography usually corresponds to a **.bib file** (BibTeX or BibLaTeX format) that stores all entries used for citation and reference management.

## Delimitation (Scope and Exclusions)

A bibliography is not the same as:

- a **[citation](citation.md)**, which is an in-text reference to a work;
- a **[library](library.md)**, which stores physical or digital documents;
- a **database connection**, which may serve as a data source for bibliographic information but is not itself a bibliography.

## Validity

Applicable to all contexts in which bibliographic metadata is collected, organized, and exported — independent of citation style (BibTeX, BibLaTeX, CSL, etc.) or output format (PDF, HTML, DOCX).  
Valid both for local files and online collections managed through JabRef integrations.

## Naming and Uniqueness

Each bibliography is typically represented by a **file path** or **project identifier**.
Within a bibliography, every **[citation key](citation-key.md)** (BibTeX key) must be unique to ensure unambiguous citation references.

## Open Issues / Uncertainties

The distinction between *references*, *bibliography* and *database* may vary across user communities.
