# Bibliography

**Synonyms:** Literature list

## Meaning

A **bibliography** is a structured list or catalog of written works, such as books, articles, reports, or other publications, usually organized for scholarly or informational purposes.
It can describe *all* literature relevant to a topic, not only those directly cited in a specific work.

In JabRef and literature management, a bibliography represents a **conceptual collection of bibliographic records** — the intellectual set of works compiled for study, documentation, or publication.

## Delimitation (Scope and Exclusions)

* **Not the same as references:**
  *[References](references.md)* are the specific sources cited within a publication; a *bibliography* may also include works *consulted but not cited*.
* **Not the same as a [library](library.md):**
  A *library* is the concrete storage file (e.g., a `.bib` file) containing bibliographic data.
  A *bibliography* is the logical or thematic organization of that data.
* **Not a [citation](citation.md):**
  A *citation* is an inline or textual reference to one bibliographic entry.

## Validity

A bibliography can exist:

* as part of a publication (e.g., “Bibliography” or “Works consulted” section),
* as a standalone compilation (e.g., “Annotated bibliography”),
* or as a conceptual subset within a reference manager such as JabRef.

## Naming and Uniqueness

Bibliographies may be organized by:

* topic,
* author,
* period,
* or purpose (e.g., *project bibliography*, *course reading list*).

Uniqueness is defined by content and context, not by file identity.

## Open Issues / Uncertainties

* The distinction between “bibliography” and “references” is blurred in many publication styles.
* Some citation styles (e.g., APA, IEEE) use the term “References” exclusively, even when a broader list would qualify as a bibliography.

## Related Terms (Cross-References)

* [References](references.md)
* [Library](library.md)
* [Entry](entry.md)
* [Citation](citation.md)
