# Architecture and Components

This page discusses JabRef's main architecture and components.
Note that components are seen as "logical" components and summarize features and "real" code-components.

## High-level architecture

In JabRef's code structure,

The `model` package encompasses the most important data structures (`BibDatases`, `BibEntries`, `Events`, and related aspects) and has minimal logic attached.
The `logic` package is responsible for business logic such as reading/writing/importing/exporting and manipulating the `model`, and it is structured often as an API the `gui` can call and use.
Only the `gui` knows the user and their preferences and can interact with them to help them solving tasks.
For each layer, we form packages according to their responsibility, i.e., vertical structuring.
The `model` classes should have no dependencies to other classes of JabRef and the `logic` classes should only depend on `model` classes.
The `cli` package bundles classes that are responsible for JabRef's command line interface.
The `preferences` package represents all information customizable by a user for their personal needs.

We use an event bus to publish events from the `model` to the other layers.
This allows us to keep the architecture but still react upon changes within the core in the outer layers.
Note that we are currently switching to JavaFX's observables, as we aim for a stronger coupling to the data producers.

### Package Structure

Permitted dependencies in our architecture are:

```monospaced
gui --> logic --> model
gui ------------> model
gui ------------> preferences
gui ------------> cli
gui ------------> global classes

logic ------------> model

global classes ------------> everywhere

cli ------------> model
cli ------------> logic
cli ------------> global classes
cli ------------> preferences
```

All packages and classes which are currently not part of these packages (we are still in the process of structuring) are considered as gui classes from a dependency standpoint.

### Most Important Classes and their Relation

Both GUI and CLI are started via the `JabRefMain` which, in turn, calls `JabRef` which then decides whether the GUI (`JabRefFrame`) or the CLI (`JabRefCLI` and a lot of code in `JabRef`) will be started. The `JabRefFrame` represents the Window which contains a `SidePane` on the left used for the fetchers/groups. Each tab is a `BasePanel` which has a `SearchBar` at the top, a `MainTable` at the center and a `PreviewPanel` or an `EntryEditor` at the bottom. Any right click on the `MainTable` is handled by the `RightClickMenu`. Each `BasePanel` holds a `BibDatabaseContext` consisting of a `BibDatabase` and the `MetaData` (which is relevant data of the currently focussed database). A `BibDatabase` has a list of `BibEntries`. Each `BibEntry` has an ID, a citation key and a key/value store for the fields with their values. Interpreted data (such as the type or the file field) is stored in the `TypedBibentry` type. The user can change the `JabRefPreferences` through the `PreferencesDialog`.

## Architectural Decision Records

JabRef collects core architecture decisions using "Architectural Decision Records".
They are available at <https://devdocs.jabref.org/decisions/>.

For new ADRs, please use [adr-template.md](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/main/docs/decisions/adr-template.md) as basis.
More information on MADR is available at <https://adr.github.io/madr/>.
General information about architectural decision records is available at <https://adr.github.io/>.

## Components

We regard each "larger" feature as component.
Each such component gets a label "component: {component-name}" to enable ease issue searching of it.
