# Contributing

See [JabRef's contribution guide](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-guide) for a howto to contribute code.

In case you aim for contributing user documentation, head to the [JabRef user documentation repository](https://github.com/JabRef/user-documentation).

For improving developer's documentation, go on at the [docs/ subdirectory of JabRef's code](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/tree/master/docs) and edit the file.
GitHub offers a good guide at [Editing files in another user's repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-another-users-repository).

In case you use some gitbook special features and you want to test them, checkout JabRef's code locally, and execute following steps:

1. `npm install -g gitbook`
2. `cd docs`
3. `gitbook serve`

Then, you can see a near-to-reality rendering of the development documentation at <http://localhost:4000>.
