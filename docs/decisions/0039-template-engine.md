# Template engine

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to choose a template engine for [custom export filters](https://docs.jabref.org/collaborative-work/export/customexports) and [AI features](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/pull/11884).

A discussion of template engines was also in [one of the JabRef repos](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/392).

A discussion was raised on StackOverflow ["Velocity vs. FreeMarker vs. Thymeleaf"](https://stackoverflow.com/q/1459426/10037342).

## Decision Drivers

* Text output has to be supported.
* It should have all necessary constructs from programming languages: loops, conditions, variables. It should support list or object (map) variables.
* It should be fast. 
* It should be possible to provide templates out of Strings (required by the AI feature)

## Considered Options

* Apache Velocity
* Apache FreeMarker
* Thymeleaf

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{title of option 1}", because
{justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | â€¦ | comes out best (see below)}.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Apache Velocity

Main page: <https://velocity.apache.org/>.
User guide: <https://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html>.
Developer guide: <https://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/developer-guide.html>.

* Good, because supports plain text templating.
* Good, because it is possible to use `String` as a template.
* Good, because it is minimalistic.
* Bad, because {argument d}
* Bad, because not in active development (but support is still available).

### Apache FreeMarker

Main page: <https://freemarker.apache.org/index.html>.
User guide: <https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/dgui.html>.
Developer guide: <https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/pgui_quickstart.html>.

* Good, because supports plain text templating.
* Good, because it is possible to use `String` as a template.
* Good, because in active development.
* Good, because it is powerful and flexible.
* Neutral, because {argument c}
* Bad, because {argument d}

### Thymeleaf

Main page: <https://www.thymeleaf.org/>.
Documentation: <https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.1/usingthymeleaf.html>.

* Good, because supports plain text templating.
* Good, because it is possible to use `String` as a template.
* Good, because it has [several template modes](https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.1/usingthymeleaf.html#what-kind-of-templates-can-thymeleaf-process), that helps to make HTML, XML, and other templates.
* Good, because it is powerful and flexible.
* Neutral, because the API is a bit more complex than the other options.
* Bad, because {argument d}

## More Information

As stated in [the template discussion issue](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/issues/392), we should choose a template engine, and then slowly migrate previous code and templates to the chosen engine.
