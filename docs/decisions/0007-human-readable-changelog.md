# Provide a human-readable changelog

## Context and Problem Statement

Changes of a release have to be communicated. How and which stile to use?

## Considered Options

* Keep-a-changelog format with freedom in the bullet points
* Keep-a-changelog format and fixed terms

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Keep-a-changelog format with freedom in the bullet points", because

* [Keep-a-changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) structures the changelog
* Each entry can be structured to be understandable
* Forcing to prefix each line with `We fixed`, `We changed`, ... seems to be read strange.

  We nevertheless try to follow that style.
