# Use Gradle as build tool

## Context and Problem Statement

Which build tool should be used?

## Considered Options

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Gradle", because it is lean and fits our development style.

### Ant

* Good, because [it offers a lot of control over the build process](https://technologyconversations.com/2014/06/18/build-tools/)
* Good, because [it has an agile dependency manager](https://blog.alejandrocelaya.com/2014/02/22/dependency-management-in-java-projects-with-ant-and-ivy/)
* Good, because [it has a low learning curve](https://technologyconversations.com/2014/06/18/build-tools/)
* Bad, because [build scripts can quickly become huge](https://technologyconversations.com/2014/06/18/build-tools/)
