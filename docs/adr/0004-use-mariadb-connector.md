Other alternatives are listed at [https://stackoverflow.com/a/31312280/873282](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31312280/873282).

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Use MariaDB Connector", because comes out best \(see below\).

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Use MariaDB Connector

The [MariaDB Connector](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/about-mariadb-connector-j/) is a LGPL-licensed JDBC driver to connect to MySQL and MariaDB.

* Good, because can be used as drop-in replacement for MySQL connectopr

### Use MySQL Connector

The [MySQL Connector](https://www.mysql.com/de/products/connector/) is distributed by Oracle and licensed under GPL-2. Source: [https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/licenses/connector-j-8.0-gpl-en.pdf](https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/licenses/connector-j-8.0-gpl-en.pdf). Oracle added the [Universal FOSS Exception, Version 1.0](https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/universal-foss-exception/) to it, which seems to limit the effects of GPL. More information on the FOSS Exception are available at [https://www.mysql.com/de/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception/](https://www.mysql.com/de/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception/).

* Good, because it stems from the same development team than MySQL
* Bad, because the "Universal FOSS Exception" makes licensing more complicated.
