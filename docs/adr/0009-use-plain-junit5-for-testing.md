# Use Plain JUnit5 for advanced test assertions

## Context and Problem Statement

How to write readable test assertions?
How to write readable test assertions for advanced tests?

## Considered Options

* Plain JUnit5
* Hamcrest
* AssertJ

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Plain JUnit5", because comes out best \(see below\).

### Positive Consequences

* Tests are more readable
* More easy to write tests
* More readable assertions

### Negative Consequences

* More complicated testing leads to more complicated assertions

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Plain JUnit5

Homepage: <https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/>
JabRef testing guidelines: <https://devdocs.jabref.org/getting-into-the-code/code-howtos#test-cases>

Example:

```java
String actual = markdownFormatter.format(source);
assertTrue(actual.contains("Markup<br />"));
assertTrue(actual.contains("<li>list item one</li>"));
assertTrue(actual.contains("<li>list item 2</li>"));
assertTrue(actual.contains("> rest"));
assertFalse(actual.contains("\n"));
```

* Good, because Junit5 is "common Java knowledge"
* Bad, because complex assertions tend to get hard to read
* Bad, because no fluent API

### Hamcrest

Homepage: <http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/>

* Good, because offers advanced matchers (such as `contains`)
* Bad, because not full fluent API
* Bad, because entry barrier is increased

### AssertJ

Homepage: <https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/>

Example:

```java
assertThat(markdownFormatter.format(source))
        .contains("Markup<br />")
        .contains("<li>list item one</li>")
        .contains("<li>list item 2</li>")
        .contains("> rest")
        .doesNotContain("\n");
```

* Good, because offers fluent assertions
* Good, because allows partial string testing to focus on important parts
* Good, because assertions are more readable
* Bad, because not commonly used
* Bad, because newcomers have to learn an additional language to express test cases
* Bad, because entry barrier is increased
* Bad, because expressions of test cases vary from unit test to unit test
