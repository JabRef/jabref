# Use regular expression to split multiple-sentence titles

## Context and Problem Statement

Some entry titles are composed of multiple sentences, for example: "Whose Music? A Sociology of Musical Language", therefore, it is necessary to first split the title into sentences and process them individually to ensure proper formatting using '[Sentence Case](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sentence_case)' or '[Title Case](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/title_case#English)'

## Considered Options

* [Regular expression](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/)
* [OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/)
* [ICU4J](http://site.icu-project.org/home)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Regular expression", because we can use Java internal classes (Pattern, Matcher) instead of adding additional dependencies

### Positive Consequences

* Less dependencies on third party libraries
* Smaller project size (ICU4J is very large)
* No need for model data (OpenNLP is a machine learning based toolkit and needs a trained model to work properly)

### Negative Consequences

* Regular expressions can never cover every case, therefore, splitting may not be accurate for every title
