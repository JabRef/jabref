# Allow org.jabref.model to access org.jabref.logic

## Context and Problem Statement

- How to create a maintainable architecture?
- How to split model, logic, and UI

## Decision Drivers

- New comers should find the architecture "split" natural
- The architecture should be a help (and not a burden)

## Considered Options

- `org.jabref.model` uses `org.jabref.model` (and external libraries) only
- `org.jabref.model` may use `org.jabref.logic` in defined cases
- `org.jabref.model` and `org.jabref.logic` may access each other freely

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "`org.jabref.model` may use `org.jabref.logic` in defined cases", because comes out best \(see below\).

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### `org.jabref.model` uses `org.jabref.model` (and external libraries) only

- Good, because clear separation of model and logic
- Bad, because this leads to an [Anemic Domain Model](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html)

### `org.jabref.model` may use `org.jabref.logic` in defined cases

- Good, because model and logic are still separated
- Neutral, because each exception has to be discussed and agreed
- Bad, because new comers have to be informed that there are certain (agreed) exceptions for model to access logic

### `org.jabref.model` and `org.jabref.logic` may access each other freely

- Bad, because may lead to spaghetti code
- Bad, because coupling between model and logic is increased
- Bad, because cohesion inside model is decreased
