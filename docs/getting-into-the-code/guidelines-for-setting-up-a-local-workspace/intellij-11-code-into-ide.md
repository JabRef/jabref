# Step 1: Get the code into IntelliJ

Start IntelliJ.

IntelliJ shows the following window:

{% figure caption:"IntelliJ Start Window" %}
![IntelliJ Start Window](guidelines-intellij-start-window.png)
{% endfigure %}

Click on "Open"

Choose `build.gradle` in the root of the jabref source folder:

{% figure caption:"Choose `build.gradle` in the “Open Project or File” dialog" %}
![Open File or Project dialog](guidelines-intellij-choose-build-gradle.png)
{% endfigure %}

After pressing "OK", IntelliJ asks how that file should be opened.
Answer: "Open as Project"

{% figure caption:"Choose “Open as Project” in the Open Project dialog" %}
![Open Project dialog](guidelines-choose-open-as-project.png)
{% endfigure %}

Then, trust the project:

{% figure caption:"Choose “Trust Project” in the “Trust and Open Project” dialog" %}
![Trust and Open Project dialog](guidelines-trust-project.png)
{% endfigure %}
