# Step 2: Setup the build system: JDK and Gradle

## Ensure that JDK 20 is available to IntelliJ

Ensure you have a Java 20 SDK configured by navigating to **File > Project Structure... > Platform Settings > SDKs**.

{% figure caption:"JDKs 11, 14, and 15 shown in available SDKs. JDK 20 is missing." %}
![Plattform Settings - SDKs](../../images/intellij-choose-jdk-adoptopenjdk-on-windows-project-settings.png)
{% endfigure %}

If there is another JDK than JDK 20 selected, click on the plus button and choose "Download JDK..."

{% figure caption:"Download JDK..." %}
![Plattform Settings - SDKs - plus button - Download JDK...](guidelines-select-download-jdk.png)
{% endfigure %}

Select JDK version 20 and then Eclipse Temurin (showing JDK 18 as example).

{% figure caption:"Example for JDK 18 - Choose Eclipse Temurin" %}
![Download Eclipse Temurin](guidelines-select-jdk-18-eclipse-temurin.png)
{% endfigure %}

After clicking "Download", IntelliJ installs Eclipse Temurin:

{% figure caption:"IntelliJ installs Eclipse Temurin" %}
![IntelliJ installs Eclipse Temurin](guidelines-intellij-installs-temurin.png)
{% endfigure %}

Navigate to **Project Settings > Project** and ensure that the projects' SDK is Java 20

{% figure caption:"Project SDK is pinned to the downloaded SDK (showing JDK 18 as example)" %}
![Project SDK is JDK 18](guidelines-intellij-project-settings-jdk18.png)
{% endfigure %}

Click "OK" to store the changes.

## Configure the Build System

Navigate to **File > Settings... > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle** and select the "Project SDK" as the Gradle JVM at the bottom. If that does not exist, just select a JDK 20.

{% figure caption:"Gradle JVM is project SDK (showing JDK 18 as example)" %}
![Gradle JVM is project SDK](guidelines-settings-gradle-gradlejvm-is-projectjvm.png)
{% endfigure %}

To prepare IntelliJ's build system additional steps are required:

Navigate to **Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler**, and under "Override compiler parameters per-module", click add (\[+]) and choose `JabRef.main`:

{% figure caption:"Choose JabRef.main" %}
![Gradle JVM is project SDK](guidelines-choose-module.png)
{% endfigure %}

Then double click inside the cell "Compilation options" and enter following parameters:

```text
--add-exports=javafx.controls/com.sun.javafx.scene.control=org.jabref
--add-exports=org.controlsfx.controls/impl.org.controlsfx.skin=org.jabref
```

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to have the value really stored.
Otherwise, it seems like the setting is stored, but it is not there if you re-open this preference dialog.
Then click on "Apply" to store the setting.

{% figure caption:"Resulting settings for module JabRef.main" %}
![Overridden compiler parameters](guidelines-overridden-compiler-parameters.png)
{% endfigure %}

If this step is omited, you will get: `java: package com.sun.javafx.scene.control is not visible (package com.sun.javafx.scene.control is declared in module javafx.controls, which does not export it to module org.jabref)`.

Enable annotation processors by navigating to **Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Annotation processors** and check "Enable annotation processing"

{% figure caption:"Enabled annotation processing" %}
![Enable annotation processing](guidelines-intellij-enable-annotation-processing.png)
{% endfigure %}

## Using Gradle from within IntelliJ IDEA

{: .note }
Ensuring JabRef builds with Gradle should always the first step because, e.g. it generates additional sources that are required for compiling the code.

Open the Gradle Tool Window with the small button that can usually be found on the right side of IDEA or navigate to **View > Tool Windows > Gradle**.
In the Gradle Tool Window, press the "Reload All Gradle Projects" button to ensure that all settings are up-to-date with the setting changes.

{% figure caption:"Reload of Gradle project" %}
![Highlighted reload button](guidelines-gradle-tool-windows-refresh.png)
{% endfigure %}

After that, you can use the Gradle Tool Window to build all parts JabRef and run it.
To do so, expand the JabRef project in the Gradle Tool Window and navigate to Tasks.
From there, you can build and run JabRef by double-clicking **JabRef > Tasks > application > run**.

{% figure caption:"JabRef > Tasks > application > run" %}
![JabRef > Tasks > application > run](guidelines-gradle-run.png)
{% endfigure %}

The Gradle run window opens, shows compilation and then the output of JabRef.
The spinner will run as long as JabRef is opened.

{% figure caption:"Gradle run Window" %}
![Gradle run window](guidelines-gradle-run-output.png)
{% endfigure %}

You can close JabRef again.

After that a new entry called "jabref \[run]" appears in the run configurations.
Now you can also select "jabref \[run]" and either run or debug the application from within IntelliJ.

{: .note }
You can run any other development task in a similar way.

## Using IntelliJ's internal build system for tests

In **File > Settings... > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle** the setting "Run tests using:" is set to "IntelliJ IDEA".

{% figure caption:"IntelliJ setting: Run tests using IntelliJ" %}
![IntelliJ setting: Run tests using IntelliJ"](guidelines-intellij-settings-run-tests-using-intellij.png)
{% endfigure %}

{: .note }
In case there are difficulties later, this is the place to switch back to gradle.

Click "OK" to close the preference dialog.

In the menubar, select **Build > Rebuild project**.

IntelliJ now compiles JabRef.
This should happen without any error.

Now you can use IntelliJ IDEA's internal build system by using **Build > Build Project**.

## Final build system checks (optional)

To run an example test from IntelliJ, we let IntelliJ create a launch configuration:

Locate the class `BibEntryTest`:
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>.
Then, the "Search for classes dialog" pops up.
Enter `bibenrytest`.
Now, `BibEntryTest` should appear first:

{% figure caption:"IntelliJ search for class “BibEntryTest”" %}
![IntelliJ search for class "BibEntryTest"](guidelines-intellij-locate-bibentrytest.png)
{% endfigure %}

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to jump to that class.

Hover on the green play button on `testDefaultConstructor`:

{% figure caption:"However on green play button" %}
![However on green play button](guidelines-intellij-run-single-test.png)
{% endfigure %}

Then, click on it.
A popup menu opens.
Choose the first entry "Run testDefaultConstructor" and click on it.

{% figure caption:"Run testDefaultConstructor" %}
![Popup menu - Run testDefaultConstructor](guidelines-intellij-run-single-test-launch-config.png)
{% endfigure %}

Then, the single test starts.

You also have an entry in the Launch configurations to directly launch the test.
You can also click on the debug symbol next to it to enable stopping at breakpoints.

{% figure caption:"Launch menu contains BibEntry test case" %}
![Launch menu contains BibEntry test case](guidelines-intellij-run-bibentry-test.png)
{% endfigure %}

The tests are green after the run.
You can also use the play button there to re-execute the tests.
A right-click on "BibEntryTests" enables to start the debugger.

{% figure caption:"Run window for the BibEntry test case" %}
![Run window for the BibEntry test case](guidelines-intellij-tests-are-green.png)
{% endfigure %}
