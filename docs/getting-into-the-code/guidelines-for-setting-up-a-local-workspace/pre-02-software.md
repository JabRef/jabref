# Pre Condition 2: Required Software

## git

It is strongly recommended that you have git installed.

* On Debian-based distros: `sudo apt-get install git`
* On Windows: [Download the installer](http://git-scm.com/download/win) and install it. Using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), you can run `choco install git.install -y --params "/GitAndUnixToolsOnPath /WindowsTerminal` to a) install git and b) have Linux commands such as `grep` available in your `PATH`.
* [Official installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Installed IDE

We suggest [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/?from=jabref).
The Community Edition works well.
Most contributors use the Ultimate Edition, because they are students getting that edition for free.

{: .highlight }
Currently, the 2023.1 version does **not** work for initial setup.
Please head to <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/other.html> and get 2022.3.3.
You can update the IDE after a proper setup to the newest version.

## Other Tooling

We collected some other tooling recommendations.
We invite you to read on at our [tool recommendations](../../code-howtos/tools.md).
