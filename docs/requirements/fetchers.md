# Fetchers

## Respect provider request limits
`req~fetchers.rate-limiting~1`

Fetchers with a documented request limit throttle requests across all fetcher instances. Limits expressed as requests per time interval are converted consistently to requests per second.

Needs: impl

## Reject external entities in XML responses
`req~fetchers.xml-xxe-prevention~1`

MODS and Medline XML imports and PICA, MARC, ISIDORE, and arXiv XML fetcher responses disable DTD processing so that external entities cannot be resolved.
