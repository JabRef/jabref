# Saving a Library

## Concurrent modification of the library file is detected on save
`req~logic.exporter.concurrent-save-detection~1`

Two processes (e.g., two JabRef instances on different machines using a network share) may write the same library file at overlapping times.
When the target file is modified by another process between the start of a save and its commit, the save must be aborted with an error instead of silently overwriting the other process's changes.
The detection is best-effort: it is based on the file's size and modification time, so it is subject to the file system's timestamp resolution.

Needs: impl, utest
