# Focus

## User Interface

### Main Table Focus
`req~maintable.focus~1`

Prevents the main table from losing focus when adding a new library or  when changing tabs.
This provides immediate keyboard interaction capabilities (such as Ctrl+V for pasting operations when changing tabs) without requiring explicit focus via mouse click.

Needs: impl
