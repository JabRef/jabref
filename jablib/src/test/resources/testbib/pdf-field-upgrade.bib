  Abstract                 = {We compare two Petri net semantics for the Web Services Business Process Execution Language (BPEL). The comparison reveals different modelling decisions. These decisions together with their consequences are discussed. We also give an overview of the different properties that can be verified on the resulting models. A case study helps to evaluate the corresponding compilers which transform a BPEL process into a Petri net model.},
