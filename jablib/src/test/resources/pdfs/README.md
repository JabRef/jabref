# Test PDF files

This folder contains test PDFs for JabRef.

In case they are generated using LaTeX, the source is available at `src/test/latex` with the same directory structure.

## `multiple-meta-data.pdf`

This PDF contains multiple sources for metadata:

- PDF metadata
- BibTeX code on the first page
- Embedded file `multiple-meta-data.bib`
- Plain text (second page)

All of these sources are used to extract the "final" BibEntry.
