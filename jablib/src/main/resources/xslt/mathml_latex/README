Use
---

There are two ways of using the library:

    * Use a local copy of the library.

        1. Download the distribution (see below).

        2. Unpack the distribution, using unzip.

        3. In your stylesheet import or include either the main
           stylesheet, mmltex.xsl, or the stylesheet module you
           wish to use, such as tokens.xsl. This example assumes
           that the distribution has been extracted into the same
           directory as your own stylesheet:

           <xsl:import href="mmltex.xsl"/>

    * Import or include either the main stylesheet, or the
      stylesheet module you wish to use, directly from the library
      website; http://www.raleigh.ru/MathML/mmltex/. For example:

      <xsl:import href="http://www.raleigh.ru/MathML/mmltex/mmltex.xsl"/>
