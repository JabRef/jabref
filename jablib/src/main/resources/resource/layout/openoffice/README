A very simple export filter that outputs a comma-separated file that can be used by Openoffice (OO) as a bibliography database.

Uses two new custom formaters: 

  - GetOpenofficeType: 
      converts the default bibtextype entries into the numeric codes that
	  OO uses to identify the kind of publication.
  - RemoveWhitespace: 
      removes all whitespace chars (newlines, tabs, form-feeds, etc) except
	  for the "space character".

Enjoy.
