# JabRef in Debian

This file tracks the status of JabRef packaging to Debian.
The current version at Debian is shown at <https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/jabref>.
Since Ubuntu is based on Debian, the JabRef version available in ubuntu (<https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=jabref>) is not higher.

At [koppor's repository](https://github.com/koppor/jabref/), required Debian adaptions to branches are tracked in `debian_x.y` branches.

In the following, libraries needing packaging are tracked.
