    - Search dialog now automatically previews first hit, and hides preview if there are no hits.
2.6b2
    - Added export formatter "Default" which takes a single argument. Outputs the string to format
      unchanged if it is non-empty, otherwise outputs the argument.
    - Added option under Options -> Preferences -> General for disabling the strict enforcing of
      correct BibTeX keys. Disabling this makes it possible to use e.g. umlaut characters in keys.
    - Modified launcher script for Windows installer to give higher heap size limit.
    - Improved autocompletion. All fields with autocompletion which have content selectors will now
      autocomplete on content selector values. For the "journal" field, the autocompleter will now
      additionally use entries from the current journal abbreviations list, and will also complete
      on the entire field up to the cursor rather than just looking at the last word only.
    - Added support for postformatter in Layout. The postformatter will be run after
      the formatters called from a layout.

      last names. Autogenerated groups are now alphabetized.
    - Modified Endnote export filter so "--" gets converted to "-" in the "pages" field.

      avoid group panel width problems.
    - Changed file link handling so all remote links classified as URL can be opened through
      the browser. Setting a different file type manually makes JabRef call a remote link using
      the handler application instead.
    - Modified Endnote/refer import filter to strip "doi:" from the %R field.
    - Modified HTML conversion so single newline is displayed in the preview (and HTML exports) as

      of entry editor tabs.
    - Fixed bug: adding external file link leads to relative path from root directory if file
      directory is set to an empty string.
    - Fixed error message when a # in a BibTeX string prevents saving. No longer states that the
      problem is in an entry, but specifies that it is in a string.

      means that the value "test \textit{case}" now matches the search string "test case".
    - Changed default table font family to "SansSerif".
    - Can now create lock file while writing a bib file. The lock file is checked before
      saving, and before scanning an externally changed file, in order to avoid reading an
      unfinished file.

    - Added possibility for custom export filters to define their own name formatters.
      This is done by adding a file named "<filtername>.formatters". This file defines
      one formatter on each line, with each line containing the name of the formatter and
      the formatter definition, separated by a colon (:).
    - Added menu items for increasing/decreasing table font size, with shortcut keys Ctrl-plus and
      Ctrl-minus.
    - Added options to automatically mark entries imported into an existing database, and to unmark
      previously marked entries when importing.

      piece together the key and avoid disturbing the continued parsing. Patch submitted by
      Stephan Lau.
    - Cosmetic change to the entry type label to the left in the entry editor.
    - Changed name handling so a single-entry name without a capital initial letter, such as

    - Added option to have JabRef search for external file when "Open file" function is chosen
      for an entry without any linked files. This is similar to what was always done in
      JabRef 2.3.1 and earlier.
    - Improved regular expression file search, so the regular expression can contain field
      markers as used for BibTeX key generation in addition to just regular fields. It is
      no longer possible to call arbitrary layout formatters, but the modifiers "upper",
      "lower" and "abbr" (for case conversion and abbreviation) can be used.
    - Ris importer now imports PB as "school" instead of "publisher" for THES entries.
    - Fixed bug 2157664: Current edit is now treated as an undoable edit in itself.

      to the user's settings on all freedesktop compliant Linux distributions.
    - Download external file now attempts to determine file type based on MIME type, using
      file extension as fallback.
    - Changed the way names are handled under autocompletion. Last and first names are

    - A table column can now be set up with fallback fields used if the main field is
      empty. Fallback fields are set in Options -> Preferences -> Main table columns by
      setting a column to "field1/field2/...". The fields will be checked in succession
      until a non-empty value has been found or al fields have been checked. For instance,
      specifying "author/editor" will result in a column displaying the author field where,
      set, and the editor field for entries with an empty author field.
    - Added special handling of autocompletion for the "crossref" field - now indexes
      words from the BibTeX key field instead of the "crossref" field. Added crossref
      to the default fields using autocompletion.
    - Added menu item and shortcut (ctrl shift E) to shift focus to the entry table.
    - Main window now remembers maximisation state from last time.
    - Improved SQL export feature so the complete information about groups, strings and preamble

      by mouse click while editing a field of the current entry.
    - Fixed missing name formatting in search dialog. Now uses same formatting as main table.
2.4b
    - Added Export to SQL database feature. Supports MySQL.
    - Added "protection" flag in Database properties. When this flag is set, JabRef will
      refuse to save the database when the file has been externally modified, until the
      changes have been reviewed and partly or completely accepted.
    - Fixed bug where the external update notification in the side pane would remain
      even if the referred database was closed.
    - Added two new search modes - display search results in a dialog, and global search.
    - Support for fetching from the command line using --fetch (contributed by
      Jan F. Boldt and David Kaltschmidt).

      as well as to automatically move the file to file directory and optionally rename
      after BibTeX key.
    - JabRef can now be extended by plugins (using the Java Plugin Framework
      JPF as the underlying technology). Currently extension points exist for:
        - ImportFormat
        - ExportFormat based on Templates
        - ExportFormat based on IExportFormat (contributed by Kariem Hussein)
        - LayoutFormatter

2.3
    - Added handling of unknown file types when synchronizing the file field.
    - Changed the way customized external file types are stored. Types are now stored in a
      way analogous to a diff from the default types. This allows default types added in later

    - Moved file preferences from General tab to new File tab.
    - Reduced horizontal size of preferences dialog.
    - Fixed handling of quotes when using the "abbr" modifier for key generator (Debian bug

      tabs and newlines.
2.3b2
    - Added % at start of signature text in BibTeX output. Parser now reads both
      old and new style.
    - When user chooses to save to an existing file, and answers that the file should not be
      overwritten, a new file dialog now appears instead of the operation cancelling.
    - Removed antialias setting for main table, because it interferes with proper rendering
      on LCDs when running under JRE 6. Removed non-optional antialias settings for entry
      editor for the same reason.
    - Changed external link handling so remote (http) links can be sent to the external
      application. Applications like Evince and Gimp can open remote links.
    - Replaced Simle HTML export filter with improved version by Mark Schenk.
    - Introduced ParamLayoutFormatter interface for layout formatters that can take an
      argument by the following syntax: \format[MyFormatter(argument)]{\field}
      Implementing classes contain a setArgument(String) method that receives the argument
      (if any) before the format() method is called.
    - Timestamp and owner fields are now set also when appending a bib file, and new options
      have been introduced to control whether imported/appended/pasted entries should have
      these fields overwritten if already set.
    - Added operations for adding file links in import inspection window, and made file
      and URL icons in the table clickable.

    - Fixed minor bug in importing preferences. General fields for entry editors are
      now updated without restarting JabRef.
    - Fixed bug in RIS and Refer/Endnote imports. Entries with editors but no authors
