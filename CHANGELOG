    - Search dialog now automatically previews first hit, and hides preview if there are no hits.
2.6b2
    - Added export formatter "Default" which takes a single argument. Outputs the string to format
      unchanged if it is non-empty, otherwise outputs the argument.

    - Modified launcher script for Windows installer to give higher heap size limit.
    - Improved autocompletion. All fields with autocompletion which have content selectors will now
      autocomplete on content selector values. For the "journal" field, the autocompleter will now
      additionally use entries from the current journal abbreviations list, and will also complete
      on the entire field up to the cursor rather than just looking at the last word only.
    - Added support for postformatter in Layout. The postformatter will be run after
      the formatters called from a layout.

      avoid group panel width problems.
    - Changed file link handling so all remote links classified as URL can be opened through
      the browser. Setting a different file type manually makes JabRef call a remote link using
      the handler application instead.
    - Modified Endnote/refer import filter to strip "doi:" from the %R field.
    - Modified HTML conversion so single newline is displayed in the preview (and HTML exports) as

      directory is set to an empty string.
    - Fixed error message when a # in a BibTeX string prevents saving. No longer states that the
      problem is in an entry, but specifies that it is in a string.

      means that the value "test \textit{case}" now matches the search string "test case".
    - Changed default table font family to "SansSerif".
    - Can now create lock file while writing a bib file. The lock file is checked before
      saving, and before scanning an externally changed file, in order to avoid reading an
      unfinished file.

    - Added toolbar button and shortcut (Alt-F) in entry editor for autosetting file links.
    - Improved ISI import filter so DOI information is included.

      output. Export now succeeds with warnings added where formatters are missing.
    - Conditional blocks (\begin{field}...\end{field}) in layout files can now be given a
      semicolon-separated list of fields as argument. All fields must then be set for output
      to be given.

    - Added menu items for increasing/decreasing table font size, with shortcut keys Ctrl-plus and
      Ctrl-minus.
    - Added options to automatically mark entries imported into an existing database, and to unmark
      previously marked entries when importing.
    - Added ":(x)" modifier to key generator, specifying that the arbitrary string x

    - Cosmetic change to the entry type label to the left in the entry editor.
    - Changed name handling so a single-entry name without a capital initial letter, such as

    - Fixed crash during initalization of journal abbreviation list.
    - Added option to have JabRef search for external file when "Open file" function is chosen
      for an entry without any linked files. This is similar to what was always done in
      JabRef 2.3.1 and earlier.
    - Improved regular expression file search, so the regular expression can contain field
      markers as used for BibTeX key generation in addition to just regular fields. It is
      no longer possible to call arbitrary layout formatters, but the modifiers "upper",

    - Download external file now attempts to determine file type based on MIME type, using
      file extension as fallback.
    - Changed the way names are handled under autocompletion. Last and first names are

      empty. Fallback fields are set in Options -> Preferences -> Main table columns by
      setting a column to "field1/field2/...". The fields will be checked in succession
      until a non-empty value has been found or al fields have been checked. For instance,
      specifying "author/editor" will result in a column displaying the author field where,
      set, and the editor field for entries with an empty author field.
    - Added special handling of autocompletion for the "crossref" field - now indexes
      words from the BibTeX key field instead of the "crossref" field. Added crossref
      to the default fields using autocompletion.
    - Added menu item and shortcut (ctrl shift E) to shift focus to the entry table.
    - Main window now remembers maximisation state from last time.

      by mouse click while editing a field of the current entry.
    - Fixed missing name formatting in search dialog. Now uses same formatting as main table.
2.4b
    - Added Export to SQL database feature. Supports MySQL.

      refuse to save the database when the file has been externally modified, until the
      changes have been reviewed and partly or completely accepted.
    - Fixed bug where the external update notification in the side pane would remain
      even if the referred database was closed.
    - Added two new search modes - display search results in a dialog, and global search.
    - Support for fetching from the command line using --fetch (contributed by
      Jan F. Boldt and David Kaltschmidt).
    - Support for fetching from Spires (contributed by Fedor Bezrukov).

      as well as to automatically move the file to file directory and optionally rename
      after BibTeX key.
    - JabRef can now be extended by plugins (using the Java Plugin Framework
      JPF as the underlying technology). Currently extension points exist for:
        - ImportFormat
        - ExportFormat based on Templates
        - ExportFormat based on IExportFormat (contributed by Kariem Hussein)
        - LayoutFormatter

      generate helper classes for making JPF easier. Current version used: 0.4
      http://forge.spline.inf.fu-berlin.de/projects/jpfcodegen/

    - Memory Stick Mode: JabRef automatically loads configuration settings from
      jabref.xml and also writes them there if enabled.
    - Improved handling of crossrefs. Fields are now resolved in preview and export.
    - Updated dependencies, now using: JempBox-0.2
    - Improved handling of ArXiv URIs.
    - Changed default preference value: now using import inspection dialog also
      when just a single entry is imported.

2.3
    - Added handling of unknown file types when synchronizing the file field.
    - Changed the way customized external file types are stored. Types are now stored in a
      way analogous to a diff from the default types. This allows default types added in later
      versions to appear immediately, even if the user has customized the list.
    - Moved file preferences from General tab to new File tab.
    - Reduced horizontal size of preferences dialog.
    - Fixed handling of quotes when using the "abbr" modifier for key generator (Debian bug
